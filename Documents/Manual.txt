  BRLTTY gives a braille user access to the text consoles of a
  Linux/Unix system.  It runs as a background process (daemon) which
  operates a refreshable braille display, and can be started very early
  in the system boot sequence.  It enables a braille user, therefore, to
  easily independently handle aspects of system administration such as
  single user mode entry, file system recovery, and boot problem
  analysis.  It even greatly eases such routine tasks as logging in.

  BRLTTY reproduces a rectangular portion of the screen (referred to
  within this document as `the window') as braille text on the display.
  Controls on the display can be used to move the window around on the
  screen, to enable and disable various viewing options, and to perform
  special functions.


  11..11..  FFeeaattuurree SSuummmmaarryy

  BRLTTY provides the following capabilities:

  ·  Full implementation of the usual screen review facilities.

  ·  Choice between block, underline, or no cursor.

  ·  Optional underline to indicate specially highlighted text.

  ·  Optional use of blinking (rates individually settable) for cursor,
     special highlighting underline, and/or capital letters.


  ·  Screen freezing for leisurely review.

  ·  Intelligent cursor routing, allowing easy fetching of cursor within
     text editors, web browsers, etc., without moving ones hands from
     the braille display.

  ·  A cut-and-paste function (linear or rectangular) which is
     particularly useful for copying long file names, copying text
     between virtual terminals, entering complicated commands, etc.

  ·  Table driven in-line contracted braille (english grade 2 provided).

  ·  Support for multiple braille codes.

  ·  Ability to identify an unknown character.

  ·  Ability to inspect character highlighting.

  ·  An on-line help facility for braille display commands.

  ·  A preferences menu.

  ·  Basic speech support.

  ·  Modular design allowing relatively easy addition of drivers for
     other braille displays and speech synthesizers.


  11..22..  SSyysstteemm RReeqquuiirreemmeennttss

  To date, BRLTTY runs under Linux and Solaris.  While ports to other
  Unix-like operating systems aren't currently planned, we do welcome
  any interest in such projects.


     LLiinnuuxx
        This software has been tested on a variety of Linux systems:

     ·  Desktops, laptops, and some PDAs.

     ·  Processors from a 386SX20 to a Pentium.

     ·  A huge range of memory sizes.

     ·  Several distributions including Debian, Red Hat, Slackware, and
        SuSE.

     ·  Many kernels, including 1.2.13, 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4.

     ·  A DEC Alpha (only tested once under Red Hat Alpha Linux on a
        noname board kindly lent to the Cambridge University Computer
        Laboratory by DEC in Reading, England).

     SSoollaarriiss
        This software has been tested on the following Solaris systems:

     ·  The Sparc architecture.

     ·  Releases 7, 8, and 9.

  On Linux, BRLTTY can inspect the content of the screen completely
  independently of any logged in user.  It does this by using a special
  device which provides easy access to the contents of the current
  virtual console.  This device was introduced in version 1.1.92 of the
  Linux kernel, and is normally called either /dev/vcsa or /dev/vcsa0
  (on systems with devfs it's called /dev/vcc/a).  For this reason,
  Linux kernel 1.1.92 or later is required if BRLTTY is to be used in
  this way.  This capability:

  ·  Allows BRLTTY to be started very early in the system boot sequence.

  ·  Enables the braille display to be fully operational during the
     login prompt.

  ·  Makes it much easier for a braille user to perform boot-time system
     administration tasks.

  A patch for the screen program is provide (see the Patches
  subdirectory).  It allows BRLTTY to access screen's screen image via
  shared memory, and, therefore, allows BRLTTY to be used quite
  effectively on platforms which don't have their own screen content
  inspection facility.  The main weakness of the screen approach is that
  BRLTTY can't be started until the user has logged in.

  In order for BRLTTY to successfully communicate with the refreshable
  braille display, the correct driver (serial, parallel, USB) must be
  configured into the kernel.  If the driver requires special options,
  then they must be supplied.  If it's built into the kernel, then its
  options must be:

     LLiinnuuxx

     ·  Set during the kernel configuration procedure.

     ·  Supplied at the LILO boot prompt.

     ·  Specified on an append directive in /etc/lilo.conf.

  If the driver is a module, then its options must be:

     LLiinnuuxx

     ·  Supplied as options to the modprobe (or insmod) command.

     ·  Specified on an options directive in /etc/modules.conf (called
        /etc/conf.modules by some older distributions).

  BRLTTY only works with text-based consoles and applications.  It can
  be used with curses-based applications, but not with any application
  which either uses special VGA features or requires a graphics console
  (like the X Window system).

  You must also, of course, possess a supported refreshable braille
  display (see section ``Supported Braille Displays'' for the complete
  list).  We hope that additional displays will be supported in the
  future, so, if you have any vaguely technical programming information
  for a device which you'd like to see supported, then please let us
  know (see section ``Contact Information'').

  Finally, you need tools to build the executable from its source: make,
  C and C++ compilers, yacc, awk, etc.  The development tools provided
  with standard Unix distributions should suffice.  If you have
  problems, then contact us and we'll compile a binary for you.


  22..  TThhee BBuuiilldd PPrroocceedduurree

  BRLTTY can be downloaded from its web site (see section ``Contact
  Information'' for its location).  All releases are provided as
  compressed ``tar balls''.  Newer releases are also provided as ``RPM''
  (RedHat Package Manager) files.

  That tidbit of information has probably peaked your curiosity, and now
  you just can't wait to get started.  It's a good idea, though, to
  first become familiar with the files which will ultimately be
  installed.


  22..11..  IInnssttaalllleedd FFiillee HHiieerraarrcchhyy

  The build procedure should result in the installation of the following
  files:

     //bbiinn//

        bbrrllttttyy
           The BRLTTY program.

        ````iinnssttaallll--bbrrllttttyy''''
           A ``utility'' for copying BRLTTY's ``installed file
           hierarchy'' from one location to another.

     //eettcc//bbrrllttttyy//
        Your installation of BRLTTY may not have all of the following
        types of files.  They're only created as needed based on the
        build options you select (see ``Build Options'').

        **..ccoonnff
           Driver-specific configuration data.  Their names look more or
           less like brltty-_d_r_i_v_e_r.conf, where _d_r_i_v_e_r is the two-letter
           ``driver identification code''.

        **..ccttbb
           Contraction tables (see section ``Contracted Braille'' for
           details).  Their names look like _l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e-_c_o_u_n_t_r_y-_l_e_v_e_l.ctb.

        **..hhllpp
           Driver-specific help pages.  Their names look more or less
           like brltty-_d_r_i_v_e_r.hlp, where _d_r_i_v_e_r is the two-letter
           ``driver identification code''.

        **..ttbbll
           Translation tables (see section ``Translation Tables'' for
           details).  Their names look like text._l_a_n_g_u_a_g_e.tbl.  Tables
           designed for use with character sets other than iso-8859-1
           have names which indicate this fact.  There are also a couple
           of special tables which map character highlighting attributes
           to braille dots: attrib.tbl does it the original way, and
           attributes.tbl does it the current way.

     //lliibb//bbrrllttttyy//
        Your installation of BRLTTY may not have all of the following
        types of files.  They're only created as needed based on the
        build options you select (see ``Build Options'').

        bbrrllttttyy--bbrrll..llsstt
           A list of the braille display drivers which have been built
           as dynamically loadable shared objects, and, therefore, which
           can be selected at run-time.  Each line consists of the two-
           letter identification code for a driver, a tab character, and
           a description of the braille display which that driver is
           for.

        lliibbbbrrllttttyybb_d_r_i_v_e_r..ssoo..11
           The dynamically loadable driver for a braille display, where
           _d_r_i_v_e_r is the two-letter ``driver identification code''.


        bbrrllttttyy--ssppkk..llsstt
           A list of the speech synthesizer drivers which have been
           built as dynamically loadable shared objects, and, therefore,
           which can be selected at run-time.  Each line consists of the
           two-letter identification code for a driver, a tab character,
           and a description of the speech synthesizer which that driver
           is for.

        lliibbbbrrllttttyyss_d_r_i_v_e_r..ssoo..11
           The dynamically loadable driver for a speech synthesizer,
           where _d_r_i_v_e_r is the two-letter ``driver identification
           code''.

  Some optional files which you should be aware of, although they aren't
  part of the installed file hierarchy, are:

     //eettcc//bbrrllttttyy..ccoonnff
        The system defaults configuration file.  It's created by the
        system administrator.  See ``The Configuration File'' for
        details.

     //eettcc//bbrrllttttyy--_d_r_i_v_e_r..pprreeffss
        The saved preferences settings file (_d_r_i_v_e_r is a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'').  It's created by the
        ``PREFSAVE'' command.  See ``Preferences Settings'' for details.


  22..22..  IInnssttaalllliinngg ffrroomm aa TTAARR BBaallll

  Here's what to do if you just want to install BRLTTY as quickly as
  possible, trusting that all of our defaults are correct.

  1. Download the source.  It'll be a file named brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e.tar.gz,
     e.g. brltty-3.0.tar.gz.

  2. Unpack the source into its native hierarchical structure.

       tar xzf brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e.tar.gz


  This should create the directory brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e.

  3. Change to the source directory, configure, compile, and install
     BRLTTY.

       cd brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e
       ./configure
       make install


  This should be done as rroooott.

  To uninstall BRLTTY, do:

       cd brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e
       make uninstall


  That's all there's to it.  Now, for those who really want to know
  what's going on, here are the details.


  22..22..11..  BBuuiilldd OOppttiioonnss

  The first step in building BRLTTY is to configure it for your system
  and/or for your personal needs.  This is done by running the configure
  script in BRLTTY's top-level directory.  We've tried to make the
  defaults fit the most common case, so, assuming that you're not
  attempting to do anything out of the ordinary, you may not need to do
  anything more complicated than invoke this script without specifying
  any options at all.

       ./configure


  If, however, you have some special requirements, or even if you're
  just adventurous, you should find out what your choices are.

       ./configure --help


  You should also check out the README file in the subdirectory contain­
  ing the driver for your braille display for any additional display-
  specific instructions.


  22..22..11..11..  SSyysstteemm DDeeffaauullttss


     --with-braille-driver=_d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the braille display driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the proper name (full or
        abbreviated) of the driver may be used.  If this option isn't
        specified, then all of the braille display drivers are built as
        dynamically loadable shared objects, and the needed one can be
        selected at run-time.  If it is specified, then only that driver
        is compiled, and statically linked into the BRLTTY binary.  See
        the ``braille-driver'' configuration file directive and the
        ``-b'' command line option for run-time selection.

     --with-braille-device=_d_e_v_i_c_e
        Specify the device to which the braille display is connected.
        If a relative path is supplied, then it's anchored at /dev.  If
        this option isn't specified, then an operating system
        appropriate path for the primary serial port is assumed.  See
        the ``braille-device'' configuration file directive and the
        ``-d'' command line option for run-time selection.

     --with-text-table=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the text translation table (see section ``Translation
        Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is supplied, then
        it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and the
        ``--with-execute-root'' build options for more details).  If
        this option isn't specified, then a commonly (in North America)
        used 8-dot variant of the ``North American Braille Computer
        Code'' is assumed.  See the ``text-table'' configuration file
        directive and the ``-t'' command line option for run-time
        selection.  This setting can be changed with the ``Text Table''
        preference.

     --with-attributes-table=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the attributes translation table (see section
        ``Translation Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is
        supplied, then it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the
        ``--sysconfdir'' and the ``--with-execute-root'' build options
        for more details).  If this option isn't specified, then
        attributes.tbl is assumed.  Change it to attrib.tbl if you'd
        like it done the old way.  See the ``attributes-table''
        configuration file directive and the ``-a'' command line option
        for run-time selection.  This setting can be changed with the
        ``Attributes Table'' preference.

     --with-speech-driver=_d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the speech synthesizer driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the proper name (full or
        abbreviated) of the driver may be used.  If this option isn't
        specified, then all of the speech synthesizer drivers are built
        as dynamically loadable shared objects, and the needed one can
        be selected at run-time.  If it is specified, then only that
        driver is compiled, and statically linked into the BRLTTY
        binary.  See the ``speech-driver'' configuration file directive
        and the ``-s'' command line option for run-time selection.

     --with-screen-driver=_d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the screen driver.  It may be one of the following:

        lliinnuuxx
           This driver provides direct access to the Linux console
           screen.  It's only selectable, and is the default, on Linux
           systems.  It's default screen content inspection device list
           is /dev/vcsa /dev/vcsa0 /dev/vcc/a.

        sshhmm
           This driver provides access to the screen program.  It's
           selectable on all systems, and is the default on most.  It
           has no default screen content inspection device list.  The
           patch for screen which we provide (see the Patches
           subdirectory) must be applied.  Use of this driver, due to
           the fact that screen must be concurrently running, makes
           BRLTTY effectively useful only after the user has logged in.

        If this option isn't specified, then an operating system appro­
        priate selection is made.  If a specific driver for the current
        operating system is available, then it's used.  If not, then shm
        is used.

     --with-screen-device=_d_e_v_i_c_e
        Specify the devices which may be used to inspect the screen
        content.  If this option isn't specified, then a driver
        appropriate list of devices is assumed.


  22..22..11..22..  DDiirreeccttoorryy SSppeecciiffiiccaattiioonn


     --with-install-root=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory at which the root file system of the
        ``installed file hierarchy'' (or a partial image thereof) is
        rooted.  The absolute path should be supplied.  If this option
        isn't specified, then the local system's root directory is
        assumed.  This directory is only used by ``make install'' and
        ``make uninstall''.  Use this option if you need to install
        BRLTTY in a different location than the one from which it'll
        ultimately be executed.  You need to use this feature, for
        example, if you're building BRLTTY on one system for use on
        another.

     --with-execute-root=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory at which the ``installed file hierarchy''
        is to be rooted.  The absolute path should be supplied.  If this
        option isn't specified, then the system's root directory is
        assumed.  This directory is normally rooted at the system's root
        directory, but during ``make install'' and ``make uninstall''
        it's rooted at the directory specified by the ``--with-install-
        root'' build option.  Use this option if you need to install any
        of BRLTTY's run-time files in non-standard locations.  You need
        to use this feature, for example, if you'd like to have more
        than one version of BRLTTY installed at the same time (see
        section ``Installing Multiple Versions'' for an example of how
        to do this).

     --prefix=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory within the ``installed file hierarchy''
        where the default directories for the architecture-independent
        files are to be rooted.  These directories include:

     ·  the ``data directory''

        The absolute path should be supplied.  If this option isn't
        specified, then the system's root directory is assumed.  This
        directory is rooted at the directory specified by the ``--with-
        execute-root'' build option.

     --exec-prefix=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory within the ``installed file hierarchy''
        where the default directories for the architecture-dependent
        files are to be rooted.  These directories include:

     ·  the ``program directory''

     ·  the ``library directory''

        The absolute path should be supplied.  If this option isn't
        specified, then the directory specified via the ``--prefix''
        build option is assumed.  This directory is rooted at the
        directory specified by the ``--with-execute-root'' build option.

     --bindir=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory within the ``installed file hierarchy''
        where the runnable programs (binaries, executables) are to be
        installed.  The absolute path should be supplied.  If this
        option isn't specified, then /bin, rooted at the directory
        specified by the ``--exec-prefix'' build option, is assumed.

     --libdir=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory within the ``installed file hierarchy''
        where the drivers and other architecture-dependent files are to
        be installed.  The absolute path should be supplied.  If this
        option isn't specified, then /lib, rooted at the directory
        specified by the ``--exec-prefix'' build option, is assumed.
        The files themselves are installed within this directory's
        brltty subdirectory (which is created if necessary).

     --sysconfdir=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
        Specify the directory within the ``installed file hierarchy''
        where the configuration files, tables, help pages, and other
        architecture-dependent files are to be installed.  The absolute
        path should be supplied.  If this option isn't specified, then
        /etc, rooted at the directory specified by the ``--prefix''
        build option, is assumed.  The files themselves are installed
        within this directory's brltty subdirectory (which is created if
        necessary).

  These options are primarily useful when building BRLTTY for use on a
  boot disk.

     --enable-standalone-programs
        Create statically linked, rather than dynamically linked,
        programs.  This option removes all dependencies on shared
        objects at run-time.

     --disable-preferences-menu
        Reduce program size by excluding the preferences menu (see
        section ``The Preferences Menu'').

     --disable-table-selection
        Reduce program size by excluding the table selection entries
        from the preferences menu (see the ``Text Table'', ``Attributes
        Table'', and ``Contraction Table'' preferences).

     --disable-learn-mode
        Reduce program size by excluding command learn mode (see section
        ``Command Learn Mode'').

     --disable-contracted-braille
        Reduce program size by excluding support for contracted braille
        (see section ``Contracted Braille'').

     --disable-speaker-tunes
        Reduce program size by excluding support for the playing of
        alert tunes via the built-in PC speaker (see section ``Alert
        Tunes'').

     --disable-dac-tunes
        Reduce program size by excluding support for the playing of
        alert tunes via the Digital to Analog Converter on the sound
        card (see section ``Alert Tunes'').

     --disable-midi-tunes
        Reduce program size by excluding support for the playing of
        alert tunes via the Musical Instrument Digital Interface on the
        sound card (see section ``Alert Tunes'').

     --disable-adlib-tunes
        Reduce program size by excluding support for the playing of
        alert tunes via the FM synthesizer on an AdLib, OPL3, Sound
        Blaster, or equivalent sound card (see section ``Alert Tunes'').

     --enable-gpm
        Include an interface to the gpm application so that, on systems
        which support it, BRLTTY will interact with the pointer (mouse)
        device (see section ``Pointer (Mouse) Support via GPM'').

     --with-compiler-prefix=_p_r_e_f_i_x
        Specify the prefix (path and beginning of program name) for the
        suite of compile and link tools which are to be used.  You may
        need to use this option if, for example, you're cross-compiling
        for a different architecture.

     --with-init-path=_p_a_t_h
        Specify the path to the real init program for the system.  The
        absolute path should be supplied.  If this option is specified,
        then:

        1. The init program should be moved to a new location.

        2. brltty should be moved to the init program's original
           location.

        3. When the system runs init at startup, brltty is actually run.
           It puts itself into the background, and runs the real init in
           the foreground.  This is one (somewhat sneaky) way to have
           braille right at the outset.  It's especially useful for some
           install/rescue disks.

        If this option isn't specified, then this feature isn't acti­
        vated.

  Once BRLTTY has been configured, the next steps are to compile and to
  install it.  These are done by applying the system's make command to
  BRLTTY's main make file (Makefile in the top-level directory).
  BRLTTY's make file supports most of the common application maintenance
  targets.  They include:

     mmaakkee
        A shortcut for make all.

     mmaakkee aallll
        Compile and link the BRLTTY executable, its drivers and their
        help pages, its test programs, and a few other small utilities.

     mmaakkee iinnssttaallll
        Complete the compile and link phase (see ``make all''), and then
        install the BRLTTY executable, its data files, drivers, and help
        pages, in the correct places and with the correct permissions.
        The screen content inspection device (see the ``--with-screen-
        device'' build option) is, if applicable, created if it doesn't
        already exist.

     mmaakkee uunniinnssttaallll
        Remove the BRLTTY executable, its data files, drivers, and help
        pages, from the system.

     mmaakkee cclleeaann
        Ensure that the next compile and link (see ``make all'') will be
        done from scratch by removing the results of compiling, linking,
        and testing from the source directory structure.  This includes
        the removal of object files, executables, dynamically loadable
        shared objects, driver lists, help pages, temporary header
        files, and core files.

     mmaakkee ddiissttcclleeaann
        In addition to removing the results of compiling and linking
        (see ``make clean''):

     ·  Remove the results of BRLTTY configuration (see ``Build
        Options'').  This includes the removal of config.mk, config.h,
        config.cache, config.status, and config.log.

     ·  Remove other files from the source directory structure which
        tend to accumulate over time but which don't belong there.  This
        includes the removal of editor backup files, test case results,
        rejected patch hunks, and copies of original source files.


  22..33..  TTeessttiinngg BBRRLLTTTTYY

  After compiling, linking, and installing BRLTTY, it's a good idea to
  give it a quick test before activating it permanently.  To do so,
  invoke it with the command:

       brltty -b_d_r_i_v_e_r -d_d_e_v_i_c_e


  For _d_r_i_v_e_r, specify the two-letter ``driver identification code'' cor­
  responding to your braille display.  For _d_e_v_i_c_e, specify the full path
  for the device to which your braille display is connected.

  If you don't want to explicitly identify the driver and device each
  time you start BRLTTY, then you can take two approaches.  You can
  establish system defaults via the ``braille-driver'' and the
  ``braille-device'' configuration file directives, and/or compile your
  needs right into BRLTTY via the ``--with-braille-driver'' and the
  ``--with-braille-device'' build options.

  If all is well, BRLTTY's version identification message should appear
  on the braille display for a few seconds (see the ``-M'' command line
  option).  After it goes away (which you can hasten by pressing any key
  on the display), the area of the screen where the cursor is should
  appear.  This means that you should expect to see your shell's command
  prompt.  Then, as you enter your next command, each character should
  appear on the display as it's typed on the keyboard.

  If this is your experience, then leave BRLTTY running, and enjoy it.
  If this isn't your experience, then it may be necessary to test each
  driver separately in order to isolate the source of the probledm.  The
  screen driver can be tested with ``scrtest'', and the braille display
  driver can be tested with ``brltest''.

  If you experience a problem which requires a lot of digging, then you
  may wish to use the following brltty command line options:

  ·  ``-ldebug'' to log lots of diagnostic messages.

  ·  ``-n'' to keep BRLTTY in the foreground.

  ·  ``-e'' to direct diagnostic messages to standard error rather than
     to the system log.


  22..44..  SSttaarrttiinngg BBRRLLTTTTYY

  BRLTTY, when properly installed, is invoked with the single command
  brltty.  A configuration file (see section ``The Configuration File''
  for details) can be created in order to establish system defaults for
  such things as the location of the preferences file, the braille
  display driver to be used, the device to which the braille display is
  connected, and the text translation table to be used.  Many options
  (see section ``Command Line Options'' for details) allow explicit run-
  time specification of such things as the location of the configuration
  file, any defaults established within the configuration file, and some
  characteristics which have reasonable defaults but which those who
  think they know what they're doing may wish to play with.  The ``-h''
  option displays a summary of all the options.  The ``-v'' option
  displays the current version of the program and the selected drivers.

  It's probably best to have the system automatically start BRLTTY as
  part of the boot sequence so that the braille display is already up
  and running when the login prompt appears.  Most (probably all)
  distributions provide a script wherein user-supplied applications can
  be safely started near the end of the boot sequence.  The name of this
  script is distribution-dependent.  Here are the ones we know about so
  far:

     RReedd HHaatt
        /etc/rc.d/rc.local

  Starting BRLTTY from this script is a good approach (especially for
  new users).  Just add a set of lines like these:



  if [ -x /bin/brltty ]
  then
     /bin/brltty
  fi




  This can usually be abbreviated to the somewhat less readable form:


       [ -x /bin/brltty ] && /bin/brltty




  Don't add these lines before the first line (which usually looks like
  #!/bin/sh).

  If the braille display is to be used by a system administrator, then
  it should probably be started as early as possible during the boot
  sequence (like before the file systems are checked) so that the
  display is usable in the event that something goes wrong during these
  checks and the system drops into single user mode.  Again, exactly
  where it's best to do this is distribution-dependent.  Here are the
  places we know about so far:

     DDeebbiiaann
        /etc/init.d/boot for older releases, and /etc/init.d/rcS for
        newer releases.

     RReeddHHaatt
        /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit Beware that later releases, in order to
        support a more user-oriented system initialization procedure,
        have this script reinvoke itself such that it's under the
        control of initlog.  Look, probably right up near the top, for a
        set of lines like these:


              # Rerun ourselves through initlog
              if [ -z "$IN_INITLOG" ]; then
                [ -f /sbin/initlog ] && exec /sbin/initlog $INITLOG_ARGS -r /etc/rc.sysinit
              fi





     Starting BRLTTY before this reinvocation results in two BRLTTY pro­
     cesses running at the same time, and that'll give you no end of
     problems.  If your version of this script has this feature, then
     make sure you start BRLTTY after the lines which implement it.

     SSllaacckkwwaarree
        /etc/rc.d/rc.S

     SSuuSSEE
        /sbin/init.d/boot

  An alternative is to start BRLTTY from /etc/inittab.  You have two
  choices if you choose this route.

  ·  If you want it to be started really early but don't need it to be
     automatially restarted if it dies, then add a line like this before
     the first :sysinit: line which is already in there.

  brl::sysinit:/bin/brltty


  ·  If you don't mind it being started later but do want it to be
     automatially restarted if it dies, then add a line like this
     anywhere within the file.

       brl:12345:respawn:/bin/brltty -n


  The ``-n'' (--nodaemon) option is very important when running BRLTTY
  with iinniitt's respawn facility.  You'll end up with hundreds of BRLTTY
  processes all running at the same time if you forget to specify it.

  Check that the identifier (bt in these examples) isn't already being
  used by another entry, and, if it is, choose a different one which
  isn't.

  Note that a command like kill -TERM is sufficient to stop BRLTTY in
  its tracks.  If it dies during entry into single user mode, for
  example, it may well be due to a problem of this nature.

  Some systems experience problems if an application tries to use the
  kernel's sound subsystem before it has been initialized.  If your
  system is one of them, then you may need to disable the automatic
  starting of the speech synthesizer driver with the ``-N'' option.

  Some systems, as part of the boot sequence, probe the serial ports
  (usually in order to automatically find the mouse and deduce its
  type).  If your braille display is using a serial port, this kind of
  probing may be enough to get it confused.  If this happens to you,
  then try restarting the braille driver (see the ``RESTARTBRL''
  command).  Better yet, turn off the serial port probing.  Here's what
  we know so far about how to do this:

     RReedd HHaatt
        The probing is done by a service named kudzu.  Use the command

          chkconfig --list kudzu

     to see if it's been enabled.  Use the command

          chkconfig kudzu off

     to disable it.  Later releases allow you to let kudzu run without
     probing the serial ports.  To do this, edit the file /etc/syscon­
     fig/kudzu, and set SAFE to yes.

  If you want to start BRLTTY before any file systems are mounted, then
  ensure that all of its components are installed within the root file
  system.  See the ``--with-execute-root'', ``--bindir'',
  ``--sysconfdir'', ``--libdir'', and ``--with-screen-device'' build
  options.

  BRLTTY needs to run with root privileges because it needs read and
  write access for the port to which the braille display is connected,
  read access to /dev/vcsa or equivalent (to query the screen dimensions
  and the cursor position, and to review the current screen content and
  highlighting), and read and write accesws to the system console (for
  arrow key entry during cursor routing, for input character insertion
  during paste, for special key simulation using keys on the braille
  display, for retrieving output character translation and screen font
  mapping tables, and for making the computer's speaker beep).  Access
  to the needed devices can, of course, be granted to a non-root user by
  changing the file permissions associated with the devices.  Merely
  having access to the console, however, isn't enough because making the
  speaker beep and simulating key strokes still require root privilege.
  So, if you're willing to give up cursor routing, cut&paste, beeps, and
  all that, you can run BRLTTY without root priviledge.

  To install BRLTTY from an RPM (RedHat Package Manager) file, do the
  following:

  1. Download the binary package which corresponds to your hardware.
     It'll be a file named brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n._a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e.rpm, e.g.
     brltty-3.0-1.i386.rpm.

  2. Install the package.

       rpm -Uvh brltty-_r_e_l_e_a_s_e-_v_e_r_s_i_o_n._a_r_c_h_i_t_e_c_t_u_r_e.rpm


  This should be done as rroooott.  Strictly speaking, the -U (update)
  option is the only one which is necessary.  The -v (verbose) option
  displays the name of the package as it's being installed.  The -h
  (hashes) option displays a progress meter (using hash signs).

  For the brave, we also provide the source RPM (.src.rpm) file, but
  that's beyond the scope of this document.

  To uninstall BRLTTY, do:

       rpm -e brltty

  Building BRLTTY also results in the building of a few small helper and
  diagnostic utilities.


  22..88..11..  iinnssttaallll--bbrrllttttyy

  This utility copies BRLTTY's ``installed file hierarchy'' from one
  location to another.
       install-brltty _t_o [_f_r_o_m]



     _t_o The location to which the ``installed file hierarchy'' is to be
        copied.  It must be an existing directory.

     _f_r_o_m
        The location from which the ``installed file hierarchy'' is to
        be taken.  If it's specified, then it must be an existing
        directory.  If it's not specified, then the location used for
        the build is assumed.

  The screen content inspection device is also created (if it doesn't
  already exist) within the _t_o hierarchy.

  This utility can be used, for example, to copy BRLTTY to a root disk.
  If a root floppy is mounted as /mnt, and BRLTTY is installed on the
  main system, then typing

       install-brltty /mnt


  copies BRLTTY, along with all of its data and library files, to the
  root floppy.

  Some problems have been experienced when copying BRLTTY between
  systems with different versions of the shared C library.  This is
  worth investigating if you have difficulties.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e
        The file which is to contain all of the compiled help pages.
        The pages are numbered, starting from zero, in the same order as
        the input files are specified.

     _i_n_p_u_t_-_f_i_l_e
        At least one input file must be specified.  Each is the source
        for a single help page, and should contain plain text.


  22..88..33..  ttbbll22hheexx

  This is a helper utility which is used during the build procedure to
  prepare the default text and attributes translation tables.

       tbl2hex


  The translation table is read from standard input, and a set of hex­

  is written to standard output.

  33..  UUssiinngg BBRRLLTTTTYY

  Before starting BRLTTY, you need to set up your braille display.  In
  most cases this is done simply by connecting it to an available serial
  port, and then turning it on.  After your display has been set up, run
  BRLTTY simply by typing the command brltty at a shell prompt (this
  must be done as root).  Check the ``-d'' command line option, the
  ``braille-device'' configuration file directive, and the ``--with-
  braille-device'' build option for alternatives regarding how to tell
  BRLTTY which device your display is connected to.  Check the ``-b''
  command line option, the ``braille-driver'' configuration file
  directive, and the ``--with-braille-driver'' build option for
  alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which kind of braille
  display you have.  Check the ``-B'' command line option, and the
  ``braille-parameters'' configuration file directive for alternatives
  regarding how to pass parameters to the driver for your braille
  display.

  A message giving the program name (BRLTTY) and its version number will
  appear briefly (see the ``-M'' command line option) on the braille
  display.  The display will then show a small area of the screen
  including the cursor.  By default, the cursor is represented as dots 7
  and 8 superimposed on the character it is on.

  Any screen activity will be reflected on the braille display.  The
  display will also follow the progress of the cursor on the screen.
  This feature is known as ccuurrssoorr ttrraacckkiinngg.

  Just typing on the keyboard and reading the display, however, isn't
  enough.  Try entering a command which will cause an error, and
  pressing eenntteerr.  The error appears on the screen, but, unless you have
  a multi-line display, the chances are that it isn't visible on the
  braille display.  All you see thereon is another shell prompt.  What's
  needed, then, is some way to move the braille _w_i_n_d_o_w around the
  screen.  The keys on the braille display itself can be used to send
  commands to BRLTTY which, in addition to a lot of other things, can
  also do exactly that.



  33..11..  CCoommmmaannddss

  Unfortunately, the various braille displays don't offer a standard set
  of controls.  Some have the six standard dot keys, some have eight,
  and others have none.  Some have thumb keys, but there's no standard
  number of them.  Some have a button above each braille cell.  Some
  have rocker switches.  Some have an easy-to-reach bar which works much
  like a joystick.  Most have varying combinations of the above.
  Because the nature and layout of each display is so different, please
  refer to the documentation for your particular display in order to
  find out exactly what its keys do.

  BRLTTY commands are referred to by name within this manual.  If you
  forget which key(s) on your braille display to use for a paticular
  command, then refer to its driver's help page.  The main key you
  should immediately commit to memory, therefore, is the one for the
  ``HELP'' command.  Use the regular motion keys (as described below) to
  navigate the help page, and press the help key again to quit.

     LLNNUUPP
        Go up one line.  If identical line skipping has been activated
        (see the ``SKPIDLNS'' command), then this command, rather than
        moving exactly one line, is an alias for the ``PRDIFLN''
        command.

     LLNNDDNN
        Go down one line.  If identical line skipping has been activated
        (see the ``SKPIDLNS'' command), then this command, rather than

        lines, is an alias for the ``LNUP'' command.

     NNXXDDIIFFLLNN
        Go down to the nearest next line with different content.  If
        identical line skipping has been activated (see the ``SKPIDLNS''
        command), then this command, rather than skipping identical
        lines, is an alias for the ``LNDN'' command.

     AATTTTRRUUPP
        Go up to the nearest previous line with different character
        highlighting (attributes).

     AATTTTRRDDNN
        Go down to the nearest next line with different character

     BBOOTT__LLEEFFTT
        Go to the bottom-left corner.

     PPRRPPGGRRPPHH
        Go up to the last line of the previous paragraph (the first non-

     PPRRSSEEAARRCCHH
        Search backward for the nearest occurrence of the character

        search starts at the character immediately to the left of the
        braille window, proceeds from right to left, and, at the
        beginning of a line, wraps to the end of the previous line.  The
        search isn't case sensitive.

     NNXXSSEEAARRCCHH
        Search forward for the nearest occurrence of the character

        Go right half a window.

     FFWWIINNLLTT
        Go left one window.  This command is particularly useful when
        reading backward because it automatically wraps up to the end of
        the previous line when invoked at the beginning of the current
        line.  Other features like its ability to skip blank windows
        (see the ``SKPBLNKWINS'' command) further enhance its usefulness
        for this purpose.

     FFWWIINNRRTT
        Go right one window.  This command is particularly useful when
        reading forward because it automatically wraps down to the

     BBAACCKK
        Go back to where the most recent motion command put the braille
        window.  This is an easy way to get right back to where you were
        reading after an unexpected event (like cursor tracking) moves
        the braille window at an inopportune moment.


  33..11..44..  FFeeaattuurree AAccttiivvaattiioonn

  Each of these commands has three forms: aaccttiivvaattee (turn the feature
  on), ddeeaaccttiivvaattee (turn the feature off), and ttooggggllee (if it's off then
  turn it on, and if it's on then turn it off).  Unless specifically
  noted, each of these features is initially ooffff, and, when oonn, affects
  BRLTTY's operation as a whole.  The initial setting of some of these
  features can be changed via the ``preferences menu''.

     FFRREEEEZZEE
        Freeze the screen image.  BRLTTY makes a copy of the screen
        (content and attributes) as of the moment when the screen image
        is frozen, and then ignores all updating of the screen until
        it's unfrozen.  This feature makes it easy, for example, to
        sample the output of an application which writes too much too
        quickly.

     DDIISSPPMMDD
        Show the highlighting (the attributes) of each character within
        the braille window, rather than the characters themselves (the
        content).  This feature is useful, for example, when you need to
        locate a highlighted item.  When showing screen content, the
        text translation table is used (see the ``-t'' command line
        option, the ``text-table'' configuration file directive, and the
        ``--with-text-table'' build option).  When showing screen
        attributes, the attributes translation table is used (see the
        ``-a'' command line option, the ``attributes-table''
        configuration file directive, and the ``--with-attributes-
        table'' build option).  This feature only affects the current
        virtual terminal.

     SSIIXXDDOOTTSS
        Show characters using 6-dot, rather than 8-dot, braille.  Dots 7
        and 8 are still used by other features like cursor
        representation and highlighted character underlining.  If a
        contraction table has been selected (see the ``-c'' command line
        option and the ``contraction-table'' configuration file
        directive), then it is used.  This setting can also be changed
        with the ``Text Style'' preference.

     SSLLIIDDEEWWIINN
        If cursor tracking (see the ``CSRTRK'' command) is oonn, then,
        whenever the cursor moves too close to (or beyond) either end of
        the braille window, horizontally reposition the window such that
        the cursor, while remaining on that side, is nearer the centre.
        If this feature is ooffff, then the braille window is always
        positioned such that its left end is a multiple of its width
        from the left edge of the screen.  This setting can also be
        changed with the ``Sliding Window'' preference.

     SSKKPPIIDDLLNNSS
        Rather than explicitly moving exactly one line either up or
        down, skip passed lines which have the same content as the
        current line.  This feature affects the ``LNUP'' and ``LNDN''
        commands, as well as the line wrapping feature of the
        ``FWINLT'', ``FWINRT'', ``FWINLTSKIP'', and ``FWINRTSKIP''
        commands.  This setting can also be changed with the ``Skip
        Identical Lines'' preference.

     SSKKPPBBLLNNKKWWIINNSS
        Skip passed blank windows when reading either forward or
        backward.  This feature affects the ``FWINLT'' and ``FWINRT''
        commands.  This setting can also be changed with the ``Skip
        Blank Windows'' preference.

     CCSSRRVVIISS
        Show the cursor by superimposing a dot pattern (see the
        ``CSRSIZE'' command) on top of the character where it is.  This
        feature is initially oonn.  This setting can also be changed with
        the ``Show Cursor'' preference.

     CCSSRRHHIIDDEE
        Hide the cursor (see the ``CSRVIS'' command) in order to
        accurately read the character beneath it.  This feature only
        affects the current virtual terminal.

     CCSSRRTTRRKK
        Track (follow) the cursor.  If the cursor moves to a location
        which isn't within the braille window, then automatically move
        the braille window to the cursor's new location.  You'll usually
        want this feature turned on since it minimizes the effects of
        screen scrolling, and since, during input, the region wherein
        you're currently typing is always visible.  If this feature
        causes the braille window to jump at an inopportune moment, then
        use the ``BACK'' command to get back to where you were reading.
        You may need to turn this feature off when using an application
        which continually updates the screen while maintaining a fixed
        data layout.  This feature is initially oonn.  This feature only
        affects the current virtual terminal.

     CCSSRRSSIIZZEE
        Represent the cursor with all eight dots (a solid block), rather
        than with just dots 7 and 8 (an underline).  This setting can
        also be changed with the ``Cursor Style'' preference.

     CCSSRRBBLLIINNKK
        Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval) the
        symbol representing the cursor (see the ``CSRVIS'' command).
        This setting can also be changed with the ``Blinking Cursor''
        preference.

     AATTTTRRVVIISS
        Underline (with combinations of dots 7 and 8) highlighted
        characters.

        nnoo uunnddeerrlliinnee
           White on black (normal), gray on black, white on blue, black
           on cyan.

        ddoottss 77 aanndd 88
           Black on white (reverse video).

        ddoott 88
           Everything else.

        This setting can also be changed with the ``Show Attributes''
        preference.

     AATTTTRRBBLLIINNKK
        Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval) the
        attribute underline (see the ``ATTRVIS'' command).  This feature
        is initially oonn.  This setting can also be changed with the
        ``Blinking Attributes'' preference.

     CCAAPPBBLLIINNKK
        Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
        capital (uppercase) letters.  This setting can also be changed
        with the ``Blinking Capitals'' preference.

     TTUUNNEESS
        Play a short predefined tune (see ``Alert Tunes'') whenever a
        significant event occurs.  This feature is initially oonn.  This
        setting can also be changed with the ``Alert Tunes'' preference.

        Switch to the braille display driver's help page.  This is where
        you can find an on-line summary of things like what your braille
        display's keys do, and how to interpret its status cells.  Use
        the regular ``vertical'' and ``horizontal'' motion commands to
        navigate the help page.  Invoke the help command again to return
        to the screen.

     IINNFFOO
        Switch to the status display (see section ``The Status Display''
        for full details).  It presents a summary including the position
        of the cursor, the position of the braille window, and the
        states of a number of BRLTTY's features.  Invoke this command
        again to return to the screen.

     LLEEAARRNN
        Switch to command learn mode (see section ``Command Learn Mode''
        for full details).  This is how you can interactively learn what
        your braille display's keys do.  Invoke this command again to
        return to the screen.  This command isn't available if the
        ``--disable-learn-mode'' build option was specified.

        Route (bring) the cursor to anywhere on the top line of the
        braille window (see ``Cursor Routing'' for full details).  The
        cursor is moved by simulating vertical arrow-key presses.  This
        command doesn't always work because some applications either
        move the cursor somewhat unpredictably or use the arrow keys for
        purposes other than cursor motion.  It's somewhat safer than the
        other cursor routing commands, though, because it makes no
        attempt to simulate the left- and right-arrows.

     PPAASSTTEE
        Insert the characters within the cut buffer at the current
        cursor location (see ``Cut and Paste'' for full details).

     RREESSTTAARRTTBBRRLL
        Stop, and then restart the braille display driver.

     RROOUUTTEE
        Route (bring) the cursor to the character associated with the
        routing key (see ``Cursor Routing'' for full details).  The
        cursor is moved by simulating arrow-key presses.  This command
        doesn't always work because some applications either move the
        cursor somewhat unpredictably or use the arrow keys for purposes
        other than cursor motion.

     CCUUTTBBEEGGIINN
        Anchor the start of the cut block at the character associated
        with the routing key (see ``Cut and Paste'' for full details).
        This command clears the cut buffer.

     CCUUTTAAPPPPEENNDD
        Anchor the start of the cut block at the character associated
        with the routing key (see ``Cut and Paste'' for full details).
        This command doesn't clear the cut buffer.

     CCUUTTRREECCTT
        Anchor the end of the cut block at the character associated with
        the routing key, and append the rectangular region to the cut
        buffer (see ``Cut and Paste'' for full details).

     CCUUTTLLIINNEE
        Anchor the end of the cut block at the character associated with
        the routing key, and append the linear region to the cut buffer
        (see ``Cut and Paste'' for full details).

     SSWWIITTCCHHVVTT
        Switch to the virtual terminal whose number (counting from 1)
        matches that of the routing key.

     PPRRIINNDDEENNTT
        Go up to the nearest previous line which isn't indented more
        than the column associated with the routing key.

     NNXXIINNDDEENNTT
        Go down to the nearest next line which isn't indented more than
        the column associated with the routing key.

     DDEESSCCCCHHAARR
        Momentarily (see the ``-M'' command line option) display a
        message describing the character associated with the routing
        key.  It reveals the decimal and hexadecimal values of the
        character, the foreground and background colours, and, when
        present, special attributes (bright and blink).  The message
        looks like this:

          char 65 (0x41): white on black bright blink


     SSEETTLLEEFFTT
        Horizontally reposition the braille window so that its left edge
        is at the column associated with the routing key.  This feature
        makes it very easy to put the window exactly where it's needed,
        and, therefore, for displays which have routing keys, almost
        eliminates the need for a lot of elementary window motion (like
        the ``CHRLT'', ``CHRRT'', ``HWINLT'', and ``HWINRT'' commands).

     SSEETTMMAARRKK
        Mark (remember) the current position of the braille window in a
        register associated with the routing key.  See the ``GOTOMARK''
        command.  This feature only affects the current virtual
        terminal.

     GGOOTTOOMMAARRKK
        Move the braille window to the position formerly marked (see the
        ``SETMARK'' command) with the same routing key.  This feature
        only affects the current virtual terminal.

  System defaults for many settings may be established within a
  configuration file.  The default name for this file is
  /etc/brltty.conf, although it may be overridden with the ``-f''
  command line option.  It doesn't need to exist.  A template for it can
  be found within the DOCS subdirectory.

  Blank lines are ignored.  A comment begin with a number sign (#), and
  continues to the end of the line.  The following directives are
  recognized:

     attributes-table _f_i_l_e
        Specify the attributes translation table (see section
        ``Translation Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is
        supplied, then it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the
        ``--sysconfdir'' and the ``--with-execute-root'' build options
        for more details).  See the ``--with-attributes-table'' build
        option for the default established during the build procedure.
        This directive can be overridden with the ``-a'' command line
        option.

     braille-driver _d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the braille display driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the full path to a dynamically
        loadable shared object may be supplied.  See the ``--with-
        braille-driver'' build option for the default established during
        the build procedure.  This directive can be overridden with the
        ``-b'' command line option.


     braille-device _d_e_v_i_c_e
        Specify the device to which the braille display is connected.
        The full path must be supplied.  See the ``--with-braille-
        device'' build option for the default established during the
        build procedure.  This directive can be overridden with the
        ``-d'' command line option.

     braille-parameters _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,...
        Specify parameters for the braille display driver.  If the same
        parameter is specified more than once, then its rightmost
        assignment is used.  For a description of the parameters
        accepted by a specific driver, please see the documentation for
        that driver.  This directive can be overridden with the ``-B''
        command line option.

     contraction-table _f_i_l_e
        Specify the contraction table (see section ``Contracted
        Braille'' for details).  If a relative path is supplied, then
        it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and the
        ``--with-execute-root'' build options for more details).  The
        contraction table is used when the 6-dot braille feature is
        activated (see the ``SIXDOTS'' command and the ``Text Style''
        preference).  The default is to display uncontracted 6-dot
        braille.  This directive can be overridden with the ``-c''
        command line option.  It isn't available if the ``--disable-
        contracted-braille'' build option was specified.

     preferences-file _f_i_l_e
        Specify the location of the preferences file.  If it's not
        specified, then /etc/brltty-_d_r_i_v_e_r.prefs is assumed, where
        _d_r_i_v_e_r is a two-letter ``driver identification code''.  The
        preferences file doesn't need to exist.  This directive can be
        overridden with the ``-p'' command line option.

     screen-parameters _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,...
        Specify parameters for the screen driver.  If the same parameter
        is specified more than once, then its rightmost assignment is
        used.  For a description of the parameters accepted by a
        specific driver, please see the documentation for that driver.
        This directive can be overridden with the ``-X'' command line
        option.

     speech-driver _d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the speech synthesizer driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the full path to a dynamically
        loadable shared object may be supplied.  See the ``--with-
        speech-driver'' build option for the default established during
        the build procedure.  This directive can be overridden with the
        ``-s'' command line option.

     speech-parameters _n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,...
        Specify parameters for the speech synthesizer driver.  If the
        same parameter is specified more than once, then its rightmost
        assignment is used.  For a description of the parameters
        accepted by a specific driver, please see the documentation for
        that driver.  This directive can be overridden with the ``-S''
        command line option.

     text-table _f_i_l_e
        Specify the text translation table (see section ``Translation
        Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is supplied, then
        it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and the
        ``--with-execute-root'' build options for more details).  See
        the ``--with-text-table'' build option for the default
        established during the build procedure.  This directive can be
        overridden with the ``-t'' command line option.

        Specify the attributes translation table (see section
        ``Translation Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is
        supplied, then it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the
        ``--sysconfdir'' and the ``--with-execute-root'' build options
        for more details).  See the ``attributes-table'' configuration
        file directive for the default run-time setting.  This setting
        can be changed with the ``Attributes Table'' preference.

     -b_d_r_i_v_e_r --braille-driver=_d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the braille display driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the full path to a dynamically
        loadable shared object may be supplied.  See the ``braille-
        driver'' configuration file directive for the default run-time
        setting.

     -c_f_i_l_e --contraction-table=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the contraction table (see section ``Contracted
        Braille'' for details).  If a relative path is supplied, then
        it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and the
        ``--with-execute-root'' build options for more details).  The
        contraction table is used when the 6-dot braille feature is
        activated (see the ``SIXDOTS'' command and the ``Text Style''
        preference).  See the ``contraction-table'' configureation file
        directive for the default run-time setting.  This setting can be
        changed with the ``Contraction Table'' preference.  This option
        isn't available if the ``--disable-contracted-braille'' build
        option was specified.

     -d_d_e_v_i_c_e --braille-device=_d_e_v_i_c_e
        Specify the device to which the braille display is connected.
        The full path must be supplied.  See the ``braille-device''
        configuration file directive for the default run-time setting.

     -e --standard-error
        Write diagnostic messages to standard error.  The default is to
        record them via syslog.

     -f_f_i_l_e --configuration-file=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the location of the ``configuration file'' which is to
        be used for the establishing of default run-time settings.

     -h --help
        Display a summary of the command line options accepted by
        BRLTTY, and then exit.

     -l_l_e_v_e_l --log-level=_l_e_v_e_l
        Specify the severity threshold for diagnostic message
        generation.  The following levels are recognized.

        00  emergency

        11  alert

        22  critical

        33  error

        44  warning


        55  notice

        66  information

        77  debug

        Either the number or the name may be supplied, and the name may
        be abbreviated.  If not specified, then information is assumed
        (see the ``-q'' option for more details).

     -n --no-daemon
        Specify that BRLTTY is to remain in the foreground.  If not
        specified, then BRLTTY becomes a background process (daemon)
        after initializing itself but before starting any of the
        selected drivers.

     -p_f_i_l_e --preferences-file=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the location of the preferences file.  The preferences
        file doesn't need to exist.  See the ``preferences-file''
        configuration file directive for the default run-time setting.

     -q --quiet
        Log less information.  This option changes the log level (see
        the ``-l'' option) to notice.

     -s_d_r_i_v_e_r --speech-driver=_d_r_i_v_e_r
        Specify the speech synthesizer driver.  Either a two-letter
        ``driver identification code'' or the full path to a dynamically
        loadable shared object may be supplied.  See the ``speech-
        driver'' configuration file directive for the default run-time
        setting.

     -t_f_i_l_e --text-table=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the text translation table (see section ``Translation
        Tables'' for details).  If a relative path is supplied, then
        it's anchored at /etc/brltty (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and the
        ``--with-execute-root'' build options for more details).  See
        the ``text-table'' configureation file directive for the default
        run-time setting.  This setting can be changed with the ``Text
        Table'' preference.

     -v --version
        Display the current version of BRLTTY, identify the selected
        drivers, and then exit.  If the ``-q'' option isn't specified,
        then copyright information, and the parameter settings for each
        of the selected drivers are also displayed, and the working
        directory, the preferences file, the text and attributes
        translation tables, and the braille display device and help file
        are identified.

     -B_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,... --braille-parameters=_n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e,...
        Specify parameters for the braille display driver.  If the same
        parameter is specified more than once, then its rightmost
        assignment is used.  For a description of the parameters
        accepted by a specific driver, please see the documentation for
        that driver.  See the ``braille-parameters'' configuration file
        directive for the default run-time setting.

     -E --environment-variables
        Recognize environment variables when determining the default
        settings for unspecified command line options (see section
        ``Command Line Options'').  If this option is specified, and if
        the environment variable associated with an unspecified option
        is defined, then the value of that environment variable is used.
        The names of these environment variables are based on the long
        names of the options they correspond to:
     ·  All letters are in upper case.

     ·  Underscores (_) are used instead of minus signs (-).

     ·  The prefix BRLTTY_ is added.

        This option is particularly useful on the Linux operating system
        as it allows default settings to be passed to BRLTTY via boot
        parameters.  The following environment variables are supported:

        BRLTTY_ATTRIBUTES_TABLE
           The attributes translation table (see the ``-a'' command line
           option).

        BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DEVICE

           option).

        BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DRIVER
           The braille display driver (see the ``-b'' command line
           option).

        BRLTTY_BRAILLE_PARAMETERS
           Parameters for the braille display driver (see the ``-B''
           command line option).

        BRLTTY_CONFIGURATION_FILE
           The configuration file (see the ``-f'' command line option).

        BRLTTY_CONTRACTION_TABLE
           The contraction table (see the ``-c'' command line option).

        BRLTTY_PREFERENCES_FILE
           The preferences file (see the ``-p'' command line option).

        BRLTTY_SCREEN_PARAMETERS
           Parameters for the screen driver (see the ``-X'' command line
           option).

        BRLTTY_SPEECH_DRIVER
           The speech synthesizer driver (see the ``-s'' command line
           option).

        BRLTTY_SPEECH_PARAMETERS
           Parameters for the speech synthesizer driver (see the ``-S''
           command line option).

        BRLTTY_TEXT_TABLE
           The text translation table (see the ``-a'' command line
           option).

     -M_c_s_e_c_s --message-delay=_c_s_e_c_s
        Specify the message hold time (in hundredths of a second).  If
        not specified, then 400 (4 seconds) is assumed.  This is the
        amount of time that BRLTTY keeps its own internally generated
        messages on the braille display.

     -N --no-speech
        Don't automatically start the speech synthesizer driver.  This
        option is unfortunately necessary on some systems when BRLTTY is
        started before the sound subsystem within the kernel has been
        initialized.

     -P_f_i_l_e --pid-file=_f_i_l_e
        Specify the file wherein BRLTTY is to write its process
        identifier (pid).  If not specified, BRLTTY doesn't write its
        process identifier anywhere.

     -R_c_s_e_c_s --refresh-interval=_c_s_e_c_s
        Specify the braille window refresh internal (in hundredths of a

        Specify parameters for the speech synthesizer driver.  If the
        same parameter is specified more than once, then its rightmost
        assignment is used.  For a description of the parameters
        accepted by a specific driver, please see the documentation for
        that driver.  See the ``speech-parameters'' configuration file

  When moving the braille window around the screen while examining the
  text, say, in an editor, you often need to bring the cursor to a
  specific character within the braille window.  You'll probably find
  this to be a rather difficult task for a number of reasons.  One is
  that you may not know where the cursor is, and that you may lose your
  place while trying to find it.  Another is that the cursor may move
  unrpedictably as the arrow keys are pressed (some editors, for
  example, don't allow the cursor to be more to the right than the end
  of the line it's on).  Cursor routing provides just such a capability
  by knowing where the cursor is, by simulating the same arrow-key
  presses which you'd have to enter manually, and by monitoring the
  progress of the cursor as it moves.

  Some braille displays have a button, known as a routing key, above
  each cell.  These keys use the ``ROUTE'' command to route the cursor
  right to the desired location.

  Cursor routing, while very convenient and effective, is, strictly
  speaking, not completely reliable.  One reason for this is that its
  current implementation assumes VT100 cursor key escape sequences.
  Another is that some applications do non-standard things in response
  to detecting that a cursor key has been pressed.  A minor problem
  found within some editors (like vi), as already mentioned above, is
  that they throw in some unpredictable horizontal motion when vertical
  motion is requested because they don't allow the cursor to be to the
  right of the end of a line.  A major problem found within some web
  browsers (like lynx) is that the up- and down-arrow keys are used to
  move among the links (which may skip lines and/or move the cursor
  horizontally, but which rarely just moves the cursor one line in the
  desired direction), and that the left- and right-arrow keys are used
  to select links (which has absolutely nothing to do with any form of
  cursor motion whatsoever, and which even totally changes the screen
  content).

  Cursor routing may not work very well on a heavily loaded system, and
  definitely doesn't work very well when working on a remote system over
  a slow link.  This is so because of all of the checks which must be
  made along the way in order to deal with unpredictable cursor motion
  and in order to ensure that any mistake has at least a fighting chance
  to be undone.  Even  though BRLTTY tries to be fairly clever, it must
  still essentially wait to see what happens after each simulated arrow-
  key press.

  Once a cursor routing request has been made, BRLTTY keeps trying to
  route the cursor to the desired location until a timeout expires
  before the cursor reaches that location, the cursor seems to be moving
  in the wrong direction, or you switch to a different virtual terminal.
  An attempt is first made to use virtical motion to bring the cursor to
  the right line, and, only if that succeeds, an attempt is then made to
  use horizontal motion to bring the cursor to the right column.  If
  another request is made while one is still in progress, then the first
  one is aborted and the second one is initiated.

  A safer but less powerful cursor routing command, ``CSRJMP_VERT'',
  uses just vertical motion to bring the cursor to anywhere on the top
  line of the braille window.  It's especially useful in conjunction
  with applications (like lynx) wherein horizontal cursor motion must
  never be attempted.

  This feature enables you to grab some text which is already on the
  screen and re-enter it at the current cursor position.  Using it saves
  time and avoids errors when a long and/or complicated piece of text
  needs to be copied, and even when the same short and simple piece of
  text needs to be copied many times.  It's particularly useful for
  things like long file names, complicated command lines, E-mail
  addresses, and URLs. Cutting and pasting text involves three simple
  steps:

  1. Mark either the top-left corner of the rectangular area or the
     beginning of the linear area on the screen which is to be grabbed
     (cut).  If your display has routing keys, then move the braille
     window so that the first character to be cut appears anywhere
     within it, and then:

  ·  invoke the ``CUTBEGIN'' command to start a new cut buffer

  ·  invoke the ``CUTAPPEND'' command to append to the existing cut
     buffer

     by pressing the key(s) associated with it and then pressing the
     routing key associated with the character.

  2. Mark either the bottom-right corner of the rectangular area or the
     end of the linear area on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
     If your display has routing keys, then move the braille window so
     that the last character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and
     then

  ·  invoke the ``CUTRECT'' command to cut a rectangular area

  ·  invoke the ``CUTLINE'' command to cut a linear area

     by pressing the key(s) associated with it and then pressing the
     routing key associated with the character.  Marking the end of the
     cut area appends the selected screen content to the cut buffer.
     Excess white-space is removed from the end of each line in the cut
     buffer so that unwanted trailing spaces won't be pasted back in.
     Control characters are replaced with blanks.


  3. Insert (paste) the text where it's needed.  Place the cursor over
     the character where the text is to be pasted, and invoke the
     ``PASTE'' command.  You can paste the same text any number of times
     without recutting it.  This description assumes that you're already
     in some sort of input mode.  If you paste when you're in some other
     kind of mode (like vi's command mode), then you'd better be aware
     of what the characters in the cut buffer will do.

  The cut buffer is also used by the ``PRSEARCH'' and ``NXSEARCH''
  commands.

  If BRLTTY is configured with the ``--enable-gpm'' build option on a
  system where the gpm application has been installed, then it'll
  interact with the pointer (mouse).

  Moving the braille window moves the pointer (see the ``Pointer Follows
  Window'' preference).  Any motion of the braille window (manual,
  cursor tracking, etc.), other than when it moves in response to
  pointer motion, moves the pointer to the character on the screen which
  corresponds to the upper-left corner of the braille window.  This
  enables a sighted observer to see where the braille window is, and,
  therefore, to know what the braille user is reading.  It also keeps
  the pointer within the braille window so that it can be found easily,
  and so that the pointer device can always be readily used as another
  way to move the braille window.

  Moving the pointer drags the braille window (see the ``Window Follows
  Pointer'' preference).  Whenever the pointer is moved beyond the edge
  of the braille window, the braille window is dragged along (one
  character at a time).  This gives the braille user another two-
  dimensional way to inspect the screen content or to quickly move the
  braille window to a desired location.  It also gives a sighted
  observer an easy way to move the braille window to something he'd like
  the braille user to read.

  gpm uses reverse video to show where the pointer is.  Underlining of
  highlighted characters (see the ``ATTRVIS'' command for details)
  should be turned on, therefore, when the braille user wishes to use
  the pointer.

  This feature also gives the braille user access to gpm's cut-and-paste
  capability.  Although you should read gpm's own documentation, here
  are some notes on how it works.

  ·  Copy the current character to the cut buffer by single-clicking the
     left button.

  ·  Copy the current word (space-delimited) to the cut buffer by
     double-clicking the left button.

  ·  Copy the current line to the cut buffer by tripple-clicking the
     left button.

  ·  Copy a linear region to the cut buffer as follows:

     1. Place the pointer on the first character of the region.

     2. Press (and hold) the left button.

     3. Move the pointer to the last character of the region (all
        currently selected characters are highlighted).


     4. Release the left button.

  ·  Paste (input) the current contents of the cut buffer by clicking
     the middle button of a three-button mouse or by clicking the right
     button of a two-button mouse.

  ·  Append to the cut buffer by using the right button of a three-
     button mouse.


  44..44..  AAlleerrtt TTuunneess

  BRLTTY alerts you to the occurrence of significant events by playing
  short predefined tunes.  This feature can be activated and deactivated
  with either the ``TUNES'' command or the ``Alert Tunes'' preference.
  The tunes are played on the PC speaker by default, but other
  alternatives can be selected with the ``Tune Device'' preference.

  Each significant event is associated, from highest to lowest priority,
  with one or more of the following:

     aa ttuunnee
        If a tune has been associated with the event, if the ``Alert
        Tunes'' preference (see also the ``TUNES'' command) is active,
        and if the selected tune device (see the ``Tune Device''
        preference) can be opened, then the tune is played.

     aa ddoott ppaatttteerrnn
        If a dot pattern has been associated with the event, and if the
        ``Alert Dots'' preference is active, then the dot pattern is
        briefly displayed on every braille cell.  Some braille displays
        don't respond quickly enough for this mechanism to work
        effectively.

     aa mmeessssaaggee
        If a message has been associated with the event, then it is
        displayed for a few seconds (see the ``-M'' command line
        option).

  These events include:

  ·  When the braille display driver starts or stops.

  ·  When the start or end of the cut block is set.

  ·  When a feature is activated or deactivated.

  ·  When cursor tracking is turned on or off.

  ·  When the screen image is frozen or unfrozen.

  ·  When identical lines are skipped.

  ·  When the braille window wraps either down to the beginning of the
     next line or up to the end of the previous line.

  ·  When a requested motion cannot be performed.

  ·  When a command cannot be executed.

  ·  When a lengthy command completes.

  When BRLTTY starts, it loads a file which contains your preferences
  settings.  The file doesn't need to exist, and is created the first
  time the settings are saved with the ``PREFSAVE'' command.  The most
  recently saved settings can be restored at any time with the
  ``PREFLOAD'' command.

  The default name for this file is /etc/brltty.conf.  A system default
  for its name can be established with the ``preferences-file''
  configuration file directive.  Its name can be explicitly set at run-
  time with the ``-p'' command line option.

  The preferences settings are saved as binary data which, therefore,
  can't be edited by hand.  BRLTTY, however, has a simple menu from
  which you can easily change them.  This feature isn't available if the
  ``--disable-preferences-menu'' build option was specified.

  The meny is activated by the ``PREFMENU'' command.  The braille
  display briefly (see the ``-M'' command line option) shows the menu
  title, and then presents the current item and its current setting.

  See ``Menu Navigation Commands'' for the full list of commands which
  enable you to select items and change settings within the menu.  For
  backward compatibility with old drivers, the window motion commands,
  which have modified meanings in this context, can also be used.

     TOP, TOP_LEFT
        Go to the first item in the menu (same as ``MENU_FIRST_ITEM'').

     BOT, BOT_LEFT
        Go to the last item in the menu (same as ``MENU_LAST_ITEM'').

     LNUP, CURSOR_UP
        Go to the previous item in the menu (same as
        ``MENU_PREV_ITEM'').

     LNDN, CURSOR_DOWN
        Go to the next item in the menu (same as ``MENU_NEXT_ITEM'').

     WINUP, CHRLT, CURSOR_LEFT
        Decrement the current menu item's setting (same as
        ``MENU_PREV_SETTING'').

     WINDN, CHRRT, CURSOR_RIGHT, HOME, RETURN
        Increment the current menu item's setting (same as
        ``MENU_NEXT_SETTING'').

  Notes:

  ·  The routing keys can also be used to select a setting for the
     current item.  If the item has numeric settings, then each routing
     key represents an integer (starting from 0), and a selection which
     is out of range is silently brought into range.  If the item has
     named settings, then the routing keys correspond ordinally with the
     settings.

  ·  Use the PREFLOAD command to undo all of the changes which were made
     since entering the menu.

  ·  Use the PREFMENU command (again) to leave the new settings in
     effect, exit the menu, and resume normal operation.  If the "Save
     Settings on Exit" item is set, then, in addition, the new settings
     are written to the preferences settings file.  Any command not
     recognized by the menu system also does these same things.

        YYeess
           Move the pointer (mouse) to the character on the screen

        YYeess
           Play the tune.

        This setting can also be changed with the ``TUNES'' command.

     TTuunnee DDeevviiccee
        Play alert tunes via:

        PPCC SSppeeaakkeerr
           The built-in PC speaker.  This setting is supported on Linux.
           It's always safe to use, although it may be somewhat soft.
           This device isn't available if the ``--disable-speaker-
           tunes'' build option was specified.

        SSoouunndd CCaarrdd
           The Digital to Analog Converter on the sound card.  This
           setting is supported on Linux (via /dev/dsp), and on Solaris
           (via /dev/audio).  It doesn't work when the DAC is already
           being used by another application.  This device isn't
           available if the ``--disable-dac-tunes'' build option was
           specified.

        MMIIDDII
           The Musical Instrument Digital Interface on the sound card
           This setting is supported on Linux (via /dev/sequencer).  It
           doesn't work when the MIDI is already being used by another
           application.  This device isn't available if the ``--disable-
           midi-tunes'' build option was specified.

        AAddLLiibb
           OPL3/SB-FM/ The FM synthesizer on an AdLib, OPL3, Sound
           Blaster, or equivalent sound card.  This setting is supported
           on Linux.  It works even if the FM synthesizer is already
           being used by another application.  The results are
           unpredictable, and potentially not very good, if it's used
           with a sound card which doesn't support this feature.  This
           device isn't available if the ``--disable-adlib-tunes'' build
           option was specified.

        The initial setting is PC Speaker on those platforms which sup­
        port it, and Sound Card on those platforms which don't.  If the
        selected device isn't available because it was excluded at
        build-time, then the first device which is available is used
        instead.

     MMIIDDII IInnssttrruummeenntt
        If the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) of the sound
        card is being used to play the alert tunes, this setting
        specifies which instrument is to be used (see the ``MIDI
        Instrument Table'').  The initial setting is Acoustic Grand
        Piano.

     AAlleerrtt DDoottss
        Whenever a significant event with an associated dot pattern
        occurs (see ``Alert Tunes''):

        NNoo Don't display the dot pattern.

        YYeess
           Briefly display the dot pattern.

        If alert tunes are to be played (see the ``TUNES'' command and
        the ``Alert Tunes'' preference), if a tune has been associated
        with the event, and if the selected tune device can be opened,
        then, regardless of the setting of this preference, the dot pat­
        tern isn't displayed.

     SSttaattuuss CCeellllss SSttyyllee
        This setting specifies the way that the status cells are to be
        used.  You shuldn't normally need to play with it.  It enables
        BRLTTY's developers to test status cell configurations for
        braille displays which they don't actually have.

        NNoonnee
           Don't use the status cells.  This setting is always safe, but
           it's also quite useless.

        AAllvvaa
           The status cells contain:

           11  The location of the cursor (see below).

           22  The location of the top-left corner of the braille window
              (see below).

           33  A letter indicating BRLTTY's state.  In order of
              precedence:

              aa  Screen attributes are being shown (see the ``DISPMD''
                 command).

              ff  The screen image is frozen (see the ``FREEZE''
                 command).

              ff  The cursor is being tracked (see the ``CSRTRK''
                 command).

              _b_l_a_n_k
                 Nothing special.

           The locations of the cursor and the braille window are pre­
           sented in an interesting way.  Dots 1 through 6 represent the
           line number with a letter from a (for 1) through y (for 25).
           Dots 7 and 8 (the extra two at the bottom) represent the hor­
           izontal braille window number as follows:

           NNoo DDoottss
              The first (leftmost) window.

           DDoott 77
              The second window.

           DDoott 88
              The third window.

           DDoottss 77 aanndd 88
              The fourth window.

           In both cases, the indicators wrap: line 26 is represented by
           the letter a, and the fifth horizontal braille window is rep­
           resented by no dots at the bottom.

        TTiieemmaann
           The status cells contain:

           11--22
              The columns (counting from zero) of the cursor (shown in
              the top half of the cells) and the top-left corner of the
              braille window (shown in the bottom half of the cells).

           33--44
              The rows (counting from zero) of the cursor (shown in the
              top half of the cells) and the top-left corner of the
              braille window (shown in the bottom half of the cells).

           55  Each dot indicates if a feature is turned on as follows:

              DDoott 11
                 The screen image is frozen (see the ``FREEZE''
                 command).

              DDoott 22
                 Screen attributes are being displayed (see the
                 ``DISPMD'' command).


              DDoott 33
                 Alert tunes are being played (see the ``TUNES''
                 command).

              DDoott 44
                 The cursor is being shown (see the ``CSRVIS'' command).

              DDoott 55
                 The cursor is a solid block (see the ``CSRSIZE''
                 command).

              DDoott 66
                 The cursor is blinking (see the ``CSRBLINK'' command).

              DDoott 77
                 The cursor is being tracked (see the ``CSRTRK''
                 command).

              DDoott 88
                 The braille window will slide (see the ``SLIDEWIN''
                 command).

        PPoowweerrBBrraaiillllee 8800
           The status cells contain:

           11  The row (counting from 1) corresponding to the top of the
              braille window.  The tens digit is shown in the top half
              of the cell, and the units digit is shown in the bottom
              half of the cell.

        GGeenneerriicc
           This setting passes a lot of information to the braille
           driver, and the driver itself decides how to present it.

        MMDDVV
           The status cells contain:

           11--22
              The location of the top-left corner of the braille window.
              The row (counting from 1) is shown in the top half of the
              cells, and the column (counting from 1) is shown in the

              braille window (see below).

           22  The row (counting from 0) whereon the cursor is (see
              below).

           33  If the screen is frozen (see the ``FREEZE'' command), then
              the letter F.  If it isn't, then the column (counting from
              0) wherein the cursor is (see below).

           Row and column numbers are shown as two digits within a sin­
           gle cell.  The tens digit is shown in the top half of the
           cell, and the units digit is shown in the bottom half of the
           cell.

  The status display is a summary of BRLTTY's current state which fits
  completely within the braille window.  Some braille displays have a
  set of status cells which are used to permanently display some of this
  information as well (see the documentation for your display's driver).
  The data presented by this display isn't static, and may change at any
  time in response to screen updates and/or BRLTTY commands.

  Use the ``INFO'' command to switch to the status display, and use it
  again to return to the screen.  The layout of the information
  contained therein is dependent on the size of the braille window.

  Command learn mode is an interactive way to learn what the keys on the
  braille display do.  It can be accessed either by the ``LEARN''
  command or via the ``brltest'' utility.  This feature isn't available
  if the ``--disable-learn-mode'' build option was specified.

  When this mode is entered, the message command learn mode is written
  to the braille display.  Then, as each key (or key combination) on the
  display is pressed, a short message describing its BRLTTY function is
  written.  This mode exits immediately if the key (or key combination)
  for the ``LEARN'' command is pressed.  It exits automatically, and the
  message done is written, if ten seconds elapse without any key on the
  display being pressed.  Note that some displays don't signal the
  driver and/or some drivers don't signal BRLTTY until all the keys are
  released.

  If a message is longer than the braille display is wide, then it's
  displayed in segments.  The length of each segment but the last is one
  less than the display's width, with the rightmost character on the
  display being set to a minus sign.  Each such segment remains on the
  display either for a few seconds (see the ``-M'' command line option)
  or until any key on the display is pressed.

  Blank lines are ignored.  Any leading and trailing white-space (any
  number of blanks and/or tabs) is ignored.  Lines which begin with a
  number sign (#) are ignored, i.e. they're comments.

       # This is a comment.


  All other lines define table entries.


  The general form of a table entry is an opcode followed by its
  operands.  The opcode and its operands are separated from one another
  by white-space.  Each opcode has a specific number of operands, and
  any text following its last operand is treated as a comment.

       _o_p_c_o_d_e _o_p_e_r_a_n_d ... _c_o_m_m_e_n_t


  The opcode is a number which tells the translator how to interpret the
  operands.  Opcode 0 can be used to assign a meaningful name to each
  needed opcode, e.g. opcode for 0 itself.  If, for example, a table
  begins with:

       0 0 opcode


  then all the rest of the opcodes it needs can be defined like this:

       opcode 1 include


  This scheme, i.e. no built-in opcode names, was chosen in order to
  allow a table for some language's braille to be written solely in that
  language itself.

  The following operand types are supported:

     ssttrriinngg
        A sequence of characters other than white-space (which
        terminates the string) and backslashes (\).  The following
        special representations are also supported:

        \\ backslash

        \f form feed

        \n new line

        \o_o_o_o
           3-digit octal value

        \r carriage return

        \s blank (space)

        \t horizontal tab

        \v vertical tab

        \x_x_x
           2-digit hexadecimal value

     nnuummbbeerr
        An integer.  It may be specified in any of the following ways:

        ddeecciimmaall
           A sequence of decimal digits (0-9), with the first digit
           being nonzero (1-9).

        hheexxaaddeecciimmaall
           A sequence of hexadecimal digits (0-9, and either a-f or A-
           F), preceded by either 0x or 0X.

        ooccttaall
           A sequence of octal digits (0-7), with the first digit being
           zero (0).
     ddoottss
        A braille symbol.  The braille dots must be specified via their
        standard numbers (see section ``Braille Dot Numbering
        Convention''), and, for a multi-cell symbol, the cell
        specifications must be separated from one another by a dash (-).
        For example, the contraction for the English word lord (the
        letter l prefixed with dot 5) would be specified as 5-123.  A
        space may be specified via the special dot number 0.

  Now for all of the details.  The opcodes here are grouped by function
  rather than sorted by number.  For a numerically sorted list, see
  section ``Opcode Summary by Number''.


  44..88..33..11..  TTaabbllee AAddmmiinniissttrraattiioonn

  These opcodes make it easier to write contraction tables.  They have
  no direct effect on the character translation.

     00 _o_p_c_o_d_e _n_a_m_e
        Assign a name to an opcode.  The name must be defined before
        it's used.

     11 _p_a_t_h
        Include the contents of another file.  Nesting can be to any
        depth.  Relative paths are anchored at the directory of the
        including file.


  44..88..33..22..  SSppeecciiaall SSyymmbbooll DDeeffiinniittiioonn

  These opcodes define special symbols which must be inserted into the
  braille text in order to clarify it.

     22 _d_o_t_s
        The symbol which capitalizes a single letter.

     33 _d_o_t_s
        The symbol which begins a block of capital letters within a
        word.

     2255 _d_o_t_s
        The symbol which ends a block of capital letters within a word.

     44 _d_o_t_s
        The symbol which marks a letter which isn't part of a word.

     55 _d_o_t_s
        The symbol which marks the beginning of a number.


  44..88..33..33..  CChhaarraacctteerr TTrraannssllaattiioonn

  These opcodes define the braille representations for character
  sequences.  Each of them defines an entry within the contraction
  table.  These entries may be defined in any order except, as noted
  below, when they define alternate representations for the same
  character sequence.

  Each of these opcodes has a _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s operand (which must be
  specified as a _s_t_r_i_n_g), and a built-in condition governing its
  eligibility for use.  The text is processed strictly from left to
  right, character by character, with the most eligible entry for each
  position being used.  If there's more than one eligible entry for a
  given position, then the one with the longest character string is
  used.  If there's more than one eligible entry for the same character
  string, then the one defined nearest to the beginning of the table is
  used (this is the only order dependency).

  Many of these opcodes have a _d_o_t_s operand which defines the braille
  representation for its _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s operand.  It may also be specified
  as an equals sign (=), in which case it means one of two things.  If
  the entry is for a single character, then it means that the currently
  selected computer braille representation (see the ``-t'' command line
  option and the ``text-table'' configuration file directive) for that
  character is to be used.  If it's for a multi-character sequence, then
  the default representation for each character (see ``opcode 6'')
  within the sequence is to be used.

  Some special terms are used within the descriptions of these opcodes.

     wwoorrdd
        A maximal sequence of one or more consecutive letters.

  Now, finally, here are the opcode descriptions themselves:

     1177 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
        Translate the entire white-space-bounded containing character
        sequence into computer braille (see the ``-t'' command line
        option and the ``text-table'' configuration file directive).

     1199 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
        Ignore the characters no matter where they appear.

     66 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters no matter where they appear.  If
        there's only one character, then, in addition, define the
        default representation for that character.

     77 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters no matter where they appear.  Ignore
        any consecutive repetitions of the same sequence.

     1155 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters no matter where they appear.  Remove
        white-space between consecutive words matched by this opcode.

        following white-space if the first character after it is a
        letter.

     1188 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
        Prefix the characters with a letter sign (see ``opcode 4'') if
        they're a word.

     2244 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters if they're either a word or at the
        beginning of a word.

     99 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters if they're at the beginning of a word.

     1100 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s
        Translate the characters if they're in the middle of a word.

     1122 _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s _d_o_t_s

  BRLTTY uses two ttrraannssllaattiioonn ttaabblleess to govern the mapping from bytes to
  dot combinations.


  55..11..  TTeexxtt TTrraannssllaattiioonn

  The first, and most important, is the text translation table.  BRLTTY
  is initially configured to use the ``North American Braille Computer

  several alternatives are provided:

  55..22..  AAttttrriibbuutteess TTrraannssllaattiioonn

  The attributes translation table is used when BRLTTY is displaying
  screen attributes rather than screen content (see the ``DISPMD''
  command).  Each of the eight braille dots represents one of the eight
  attribute bits.  Two attributes translation tables are provided:

     aattttrriibbuutteess..ttbbll
        The lefthand column represents the background colours:

        DDoott 11
           Red

        DDoott 22
           Green

        DDoott 33
           Blue

        DDoott 77
           Blink

        The righthand column represents the foreground colours:

        DDoott 44
           Red


        DDoott 55
           Green

        DDoott 66
           Blue

        DDoott 88
           Bright

        A dot is raised when its corresponding attribute bit is on.
        This is the default attributes translation table because it's
        the most intuitive.  One of its problems, though, is that it's
        difficult to discern the difference between normal (white on
        black) and reverse (black on white) video.

     aattttrriibb..ttbbll
        The lefthand column represents the background colours:

        DDoott 11
           Red

        DDoott 22
           Green

        DDoott 33
           Blue

        DDoott 77
           Blink

        The righthand column represents the foreground colours:

        DDoott 44
           Red

        DDoott 55
           Green

           Blue

        DDoott 88
           Bright

        A foreground bit being on triggers its corresponding dot,
        whereas a background bit being off triggers its corresponding
        dot.  This unintuitive logic actually makes it easier to read
        the most commonly used attribute combinations.

  See the ``-a'' command line option, the ``attributes-table'' configu­
  ration file directive, and the ``--with-attributes-table'' build
  option for details regarding how to use an alternate attributes trans­
  lation table.


  55..33..  TTaabbllee FFoorrmmaatt

  A translation table is a 256-byte binary file.  It's indexed with
  either a character or an attributes byte, and the byte at that
  position contains the corresponding dot combination.  The mapping from
  bit to dot is as follows:

     BBiitt 00
        Dot 1


     BBiitt 11
        Dot 4

     BBiitt 22
        Dot 2

     BBiitt 33

  These utilities reside within the BrailleTables subdirectory, and
  aren't built as part of the regular procedure.  To build them, first
  ensure that BRLTTY has been configured (see section ``Build

  55..44..11..  ttbbll22ttxxtt

  This utility converts (uncompiles) a translation table into a text
  file for readability and/or modification.

       tbl2txt -_o_p_t_i_o_n ... _t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e _t_e_x_t_-_f_i_l_e



     _t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e
        The translation table which is to be converted.

     _t_e_x_t_-_f_i_l_e
        The file into which the text representing the table content is
        to be written.

     -c_n_a_m_e --code-page=_n_a_m_e
        The character set used to annotate each line of the text file.

  The generated text file can, without modification, be recompiled back
  into a translation table with the ``txt2tbl'' utility.  Each of its
  lines contains lots of interesting information.

  If the -c option isn't specified, each line looks like this:


  _c_c _x_x _d_d_d (73214568)_t_t B+_b_b_b_b _n_a_m_e


  If the -c option is specified, each line looks like this:

       _c_c _x_x _d_d_d (73214568)_t_t B+_b_b_b_b U+_u_u_u_u _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n



     _c_c The character itself.  Unprintable characters are represented
        canonically.  Control characters are flagged with a circumflex,
        e.g. Control-A (character 1) is ^A.  Meta control characters are
        flagged with a tilde, e.g. Meta-Control-A (character 129) is ~A.

     _x_x The hexadecimal value of the character.

     _d_d_d
        The decimal value of the character.

     (73214568)
        The braille dot numbers.  If a dot isn't to be raised, then its
        number is replaced with a blank.  The English letter y, for
        example, would be ( 3 1456 ).  The dot numbers appear in the
        same order as on a standard braille keyboard so as to make it
        easier to visualize the braille character.

     _t_t The hexadecimal value of the byte representing the dot
        combination which is in the translation table.

     _b_b_b_b
        The hexadecimal value of the unicode number corresponding to the
        dot combination.

     _n_a_m_e
        The ASCII name of the character (only shown if the -c option
        isn't specified).

     _u_u_u_u
        The hexadecimal value of the unicode number corresponding to the
        character (only shown if the -c option is specified).

     _d_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n
        The formal unicode description for the character (only shown if
        the -c option is specified).


  55..44..22..  ttxxtt22ttbbll

  This utility compiles a translation table.

       txt2tbl -_o_p_t_i_o_n ... _t_e_x_t_-_f_i_l_e _t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e



     _t_e_x_t_-_f_i_l_e
        The source file describing the table content.

     _t_a_b_l_e_-_f_i_l_e
        The file into which the translation table is to be written.

     -d --duplicates
        Display a warning for each dot combination which has been used
        more than once.

     -m --missing
        Display a warning for each dot combination which hasn't been
        used.

  A line which assigns a dot combination to a character must contain
  that dot combination within parenthesis, e.g. (12).  The text file
  must contain exactly 256 such lines, each one, in order, defining the
  braille representation for its corresponding character.  The dot
  numbers may be specified in any order, but each must only be specified
  once.  It's valid to specify no number at all, e.g. () (for a space).
  Any number of spaces may occur any number of times anywhere between
  the parentheses.  All characters before the left parenthesis and after
  the right parenthesis are ignored.  All lines which don't contain a
  left parenthesis are ignored.

  The algorithm for locating the dot numbers is actually a bit more
  complicated because a line may contain more than one left and/or right
  parenthesis (the ``tbl2txt'' utility does this).  The first right
  parenthesis which is preceded by at least one left parenthesis is
  used.  The nearest left parenthesis to the left of that right
  parenthesis is used.  The line )((12), for example, is valid.


  55..44..33..  ttbbll22ttbbll

  This utility converts a binary translation table from one dot mapping
  to another.

       tbl2tbl _i_n_p_u_t_-_m_a_p_p_i_n_g _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_m_a_p_p_i_n_g



     _i_n_p_u_t_-_m_a_p_p_i_n_g
        The dot mapping used within the source table.

     _o_u_t_p_u_t_-_m_a_p_p_i_n_g
        The dot mapping to be used within the table being generated.

  The source table is read from standard input, and the converted table
  is written to standard output.  The following dot mappings are sup­
  ported:

  It's easy to have more than one version of BRLTTY installed on the
  same system at the same time.  This capability allows you to test a
  new version before removing the old one.

  The ``--with-execute-root'' build option allows you to install the
  complete ``installed file hierarchy'' anywhere you want such that it's
  entirely self-contained.  Remembering that it's best to keep all of
  BRLTTY's components within the root file system, you can build it like
  this:


       ./configure --with-execute-root=/brltty-3.1
       make install




  You can then run it like this:

       /brltty-3.1/bin/brltty


  When version 3.2 is released, just install it in a different location
  and run the new executable from there.





  ./configure --with-execute-root=/brltty-3.2
  make install
  /brltty-3.2/bin/brltty




  So far, this paradigm is somewhat awkward for at least two reasons.
  One is that these long path names are too hard to type, and the other
  is that you don't want to fiddle with your system's boot sequence each
  time you want to switch to a different version of BRLTTY.  These
  problems are easily solved by adding a symbolic link for the
  executable.

       ln -s /brltty-3.1/bin/brltty /bin/brltty


  When it's time to switch to the newer version, just repoint the sym­
  bolc link.

       ln -s /brltty-3.2/bin/brltty /bin/brltty


  If you'd like to get really fancy, then introduce another level of
  indirection in order to make all of BRLTTY's files for any given
  version look like they're in all of the standard places.  First,
  create a symbolic link through a common repointable location from each
  of BRLTTY's standard locations.


       ln -s /brltty/bin/brltty /bin/brltty
       ln -s /brltty/etc/brltty /etc/brltty
       ln -s /brltty/lib/brltty /lib/brltty




  Then all you need to do is to point /brltty to the desired version.

       ln -s /brltty-3.1 /brltty

  BRLTTY can run as a stand-alone executable.  Everything it needs to
  know can be explicitly configured at build-time (see ``Build
  Options'').  If the data directory (see the ``--sysconfdir'' and
  ``--with-execute-root'' build options) doesn't exist, then BRLTTY
  looks in /etc for the files it needs.  Even if any of these files
  don't exist at all, BRLTTY still works!

  If, for some reason, you ever create the data directory (usually
  /etc/brltty) by hand, it's important to set its permissions so that
  only root can create files within it.

       chmod 755 /etc/brltty


  The screen content inspection device (usually /dev/vcsa) is required
  (see the ``--with-screen-device'' build option).  It should already
  exist unless your Linux distribution is quite old.  If necessary, you
  can create it with:



  mknod /dev/vcsa c 7 128
  chmod 660 /dev/vcsa
  chown root.tty /dev/vcsa




  One problem often encountered when trying to use BRLTTY in an
  uncertain environment like a root disk or an incomplete system is that
  it might not find the shared libraries (or parts thereof) which it
  needs.  Root disks often use subset and/or outdated versions of the
  libraries which may be inadequate.  The solution is to configure
  BRLTTY with the ``--enable-standalone-programs'' build option.  This
  removes all dependencies on shared libraries, but, unfortunately, also
  creates a larger executable.  There are a number of build options
  which can be used to selectively remove unneeded features from BRLTTY
  in order to somewhat mitigate this problem (see section ``Build
  Features'').

  The executable is stripped during the ``make install''.  This
  significantly reduces its size by removing its symbol table.  You'll
  get a much smaller executable, therefore, if you complete the full
  build procedure, and then copy it from its installed location.  If,
  however, you copy it from the build directory, it'll be way too big.
  Don't forget to strip it.

       strip brltty

  At the time of writing (December 2001), the following problems are
  known:

  Cursor routing is implemented as a looping sub-process which runs at
  reduced priority to avoid using too much cpu time.  Different system
  loads require different settings of its parameters.  The defaults work
  very well in a typical Unix editor on a fairly lightly loaded system,
  but very poorly in some other situations, e.g. over a slow serial link
  to a remote host.

  A standard braille cell consists of six dots arranged in two columns
  and three rows.  Computer braille has introduced a fourth row at the
  bottom.  Each dot can be specifically identified by its number as
  follows:
     11  Row 1 (top) left.

     22  Row 2 left.

     33  Row 3 left.

     44  Row 1 (top) right.

     66  Row 3 right.

     77  Row 4 (bottom) left.

     88  Row 4 (bottom) right.

  Perhaps a picture will make this numbering convention easier to under­
  stand.
