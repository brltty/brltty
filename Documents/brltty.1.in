.SH NAME
brltty \- refreshable braille display driver for Linux/Unix
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbrltty \fR[\fIoption\fR ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B brltty
is a background process (daemon)
which provides access to the console screen (when in text mode)
for a blind person using a refreshable braille display.
It drives the braille display,
and provides complete screen review functionality.
Some speech capability has also been incorporated.
.SH OPTIONS
Options can be passed to
.B brltty
in a number of ways.
From most to least influential, these are:
.IP 1. 4
Command Line Options
.IP 2. 4
Boot Parameters
.IP 3. 4
Environment Variables
(if the
.B \-E
.RB "(" "\-\-environment\-variables" ")"
option is in effect)
.IP 4. 4
The Configuration File
.IP 5. 4
Built-in Defaults
.SS "Command Line Options"
The options are processed sequentially from left to right.
If an option is specified more than once,
or in case of a conflict,
the rightmost specification takes precedence.
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
\fB\-a \fItable\fR (\fB\-\-attributes\-table=\fR)
The path to the attributes table.
Relative paths are anchored at
.BR "@TABLES_DIRECTORY@/@ATTRIBUTES_TABLES_SUBDIRECTORY@" "."
The
.B ".atb"
extension is optional.
The built-in default is
.BR "@attributes_table@.atb" "."
.TP
\fB\-b \fIdriver\fB,\fR...|\fBauto\fR (\fB\-\-braille\-driver=\fR)
The driver for the braille display
(see Driver Specification).
The built-in default is \fBauto\fR.
.TP
\fB\-c \fItable\fR (\fB\-\-contraction\-table=\fR)
The path to the contraction table.
Relative paths are anchored at
.BR "@TABLES_DIRECTORY@/@CONTRACTION_TABLES_SUBDIRECTORY@" "."
The
.B ".ctb"
extension is optional.
.TP
\fB\-d \fIdevice\fB,\fR... (\fB\-\-braille\-device=\fR)
The device to which the braille display is connected.
The built-in default is \fB@braille_device@\fR.
.RS
.PP
The general form of a braille device specification is
\fIqualifier\fB:\fIdata\fR.
For backward compatibility with earlier releases,
if the qualifier is omitted then
.B serial:
is assumed.
The following device types are supported:
.TP
.B Bluetooth
For a bluetooth device, specify \fBbluetooth:\fIaddress\fR.
The address must be six two-digit hexadecimal numbers separated by colons, e.g.
.BR "01:23:45:67:89:AB" "."
.TP
.B Serial
For a serial device, specify \fBserial:\fIdevice\fR.
The
.B serial:
qualifier is optional (for backward compatibility).
If a relative path is given then it's anchored at
.B /dev/
(the usual location where devices are defined on a Unix-like system).
The following device specifications all refer
to the primary serial device on Linux:
.BR "serial:@serial_first_device@" ","
.BR "serial:/dev/@serial_first_device@" ","
.BR "@serial_first_device@" ","
.BR "/dev/@serial_first_device@" "."
.TP
.B USB
For a USB device, specify \fBusb:\fR.
.B brltty
will search for the first USB device which
matches the braille display driver being used.
If this is inadequate,
e.g. if you have more than one USB braille display which requires the same driver,
then you can refine the device specification
by appending the serial number of the display to it, e.g.
.BR "usb:12345" "."
N.B.:
The "identification by serial number" feature doesn't work for some models
because some manufacturers
either don't set the USB serial number descriptor at all
or do set it but not to a unique value.
.PP
A comma-delimited list of braille devices may be specified.
If this is done then autodetection is performed on each listed device in sequence.
This feature is particularly useful if you have
a braille display with more than one interface,
e.g. both a serial and a USB port.
.RE
.TP

A comma-delimited list of drivers may be specified.
If this is done then autodetection is performed using each listed driver in sequence.
You may need to experiment in order to determine the most reliable order
since some drivers autodetect better than others.
.PP
If the single word
.B auto
is specified then autodetection is performed
using only those drivers which are known to be reliable for this purpose.
