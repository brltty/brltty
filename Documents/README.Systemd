A Systemd unit for brltty can be found within the "Autostart/Systemd/"
subdirectory of BRLTTY's source tree. It's called "brltty.service". You need to
copy this file into Systemd's unit directory. You can locate Systemd's unit
directory with this command:

   pkg-config systemd --variable=systemduserunitdir

Assuming that Systemd's unit directory is "/usr/lib/systemd/user" (please
ensure to use whatever it really is on your system), define the Systemd unit
for brltty as follows:

   cp brltty.service /usr/lib/systemd/user/brltty.service

Once the unit file is in the right place, you'll be able to use standard
Systemd commands to manage the brltty service. The most common ones are:

   systemctl status brltty
   systemctl start brltty
   systemctl stop brltty
   systemctl enable brltty
   systemctl disable brltty

Nothing is automatic. If you'd like to start the brltty service right away then
use the "start" function. If you'd like the brltty service to be automatically
started when the system is booted then use the "enable" function.
