<sect>Introduction<p>
BRLTTY gives a braille user access to the text consoles of a Linux/Unix system.
It runs as a background process (daemon)
which operates a refreshable braille display,
and can be started very early in the system boot sequence.
It enables a braille user, therefore, to easily independently handle
aspects of system administration such as
single user mode entry,
file system recovery,
and boot problem analysis.
It even greatly eases such routine tasks as logging in.

BRLTTY reproduces a rectangular portion of the screen
(referred to within this document as `the window')
as braille text on the display.
Controls on the display can be used to
move the window around on the screen,
to enable and disable various viewing options,
and to perform special functions.

<sect1>Feature Summary<p>
BRLTTY provides the following capabilities:
<itemize>
  <item>
    Full implementation of the usual screen review facilities.
  <item>
    Choice between <tt/block/, <tt/underline/, or <tt/no/ cursor.
  <item>
    Optional <tt/underline/ to indicate specially highlighted text.
  <item>
    Optional use of <tt/blinking/ (rates individually settable) for
    cursor, special highlighting underline, and/or capital letters.
  <item>
    Screen freezing for leisurely review.
  <item>
    Intelligent cursor routing, allowing easy fetching of cursor within
    text editors, web browsers, etc.,
    without moving ones hands from the braille display.
  <item>
    A cut-and-paste function (linear or rectangular) which is particularly useful for
    copying long file names,
    copying text between virtual terminals,
    entering complicated commands,
    etc.
  <item>
    Table driven in-line contracted braille (english grade 2 provided).
  <item>
    Support for multiple braille codes.
  <item>
    Ability to identify an unknown character.
  <item>
    Ability to inspect character highlighting.
  <item>
    An on-line help facility for braille display commands.
  <item>
    A preferences menu.
  <item>
    Basic speech support.
  <item>
    Modular design allowing relatively easy addition of
    drivers for other braille displays and speech synthesizers.
  <item>
    An application programming interface.
</itemize>

<sect1>System Requirements<p>
To date, BRLTTY runs under Linux, Solaris, and OpenBSD.
While ports to other Unix-like operating systems aren't currently planned,
we do welcome any interest in such projects.

<descrip>
  <tag/Linux/
    This software has been tested on a variety of Linux systems:
    <itemize>
      <item>
        Desktops, laptops, and some PDAs.
      <item>
        Processors from a 386SX20 to a Pentium.
      <item>
        A huge range of memory sizes.
      <item>
        Several distributions including Debian, Red Hat, Slackware, and SuSE.
      <item>
        Many kernels, including 1.2.13, 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4.
      <item>
        A DEC Alpha
        (only tested once under Red Hat Alpha Linux on a noname board kindly lent
        to the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory by DEC in Reading, England).
    </itemize>
  <tag/OpenBSD/
    This software has been tested on the following OpenBSD systems:
    <itemize>
      <item>
        The Intel architecture (release 3.4).
    </itemize>
  <tag/Solaris/
    This software has been tested on the following Solaris systems:
    <itemize>
      <item>
        The Sparc architecture (releases 7, 8, and 9).
      <item>
        The Intel architecture (release 9).
    </itemize>
</descrip>

On Linux, BRLTTY can inspect the content of the screen
completely independently of any logged in user.
It does this by using a special device
which provides easy access to the contents of the current virtual console.  
This device was introduced in version 1.1.92 of the Linux kernel,
and is normally called either <tt>/dev/vcsa</> or <tt>/dev/vcsa0</>
(on systems with <tt/devfs/ it's called <tt>/dev/vcc/a</>).
For this reason, Linux kernel 1.1.92 or later is required
if BRLTTY is to be used in this way.
This capability:
<itemize>
  <item>
    Allows BRLTTY to be started very early in the system boot sequence.
  <item>
    Enables the braille display to be fully operational during the login prompt.
  <item>
    Makes it much easier for a braille user to perform boot-time system administration tasks.
</itemize>

A patch for the <tt/screen/ program is provide
(see the <tt/Patches/ subdirectory).
It allows BRLTTY to access <tt/screen/'s screen image via shared memory,
and, therefore, allows BRLTTY to be used quite effectively on platforms
which don't have their own screen content inspection facility.
The main weakness of the <tt/screen/ approach is that 
BRLTTY can't be started until the user has logged in.

In order for BRLTTY to successfully communicate with the refreshable braille display,
the correct driver (serial, parallel, USB) must be configured into the kernel.
If the driver requires special options, then they must be supplied.
If it's built into the kernel, then its options must be:
<descrip>
  <tag/Linux/
    <itemize>
      <item>
        Set during the kernel configuration procedure.
      <item>
        Supplied at the LILO boot prompt.
      <item>
        Specified on an <tt/append/ directive in <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</>.
    </itemize>
</descrip>
If the driver is a module, then its options must be:
<descrip>
  <tag/Linux/
    <itemize>
      <item>
        Supplied as options to the <tt/modprobe/ (or <tt/insmod/) command.
      <item>
        Specified on an <tt/options/ directive in <tt>/etc/modules.conf</>
        (called <tt>/etc/conf.modules</> by some older distributions).
    </itemize>
</descrip>

BRLTTY only works with text-based consoles and applications.
It can be used with <tt/curses/-based applications,
but not with any application which
either uses special VGA features
or requires a graphics console (like the X Window system).

You must also, of course, possess a supported refreshable braille display
(see section <ref id="displays" name="Supported Braille Displays"> for the complete list).
We hope that additional displays will be supported in the future, so,
if you have any vaguely technical programming information
for a device which you'd like to see supported,
then please let us know (see section <ref id="contact" name="Contact Information">).

Finally, you need tools to build the executable from its source:
<tt/make/, <tt/C/ and <tt/C++/ compilers, <tt/yacc/, <tt/awk/, etc.
The development tools provided with standard Unix distributions should suffice.
If you have problems,
then contact us and we'll compile a binary for you.

<sect>The Build Procedure<p>
BRLTTY can be downloaded from its web site
(see section <ref id="contact" name="Contact Information"> for its location).
All releases are provided as compressed <ref id="tar" name="tar balls">.
Newer releases are also provided as <ref id="rpm" name="RPM"> (RedHat Package Manager) files.

That tidbit of information has probably peaked your curiosity,
and now you just can't wait to get started.
It's a good idea, though,
to first become familiar with the files which will ultimately be installed.

<sect1>Installed File Hierarchy<label id="hierarchy"><p>
The build procedure should result in the installation of the following files:
<descrip>
  <tag>/bin/</>
    <descrip>
      <tag>brltty</tag>
        The BRLTTY program.
      <tag><ref id="utility-brltty-install" name="brltty-install"></tag>
        A utility for copying BRLTTY's
        <ref id="hierarchy" name="installed file hierarchy">
        from one location to another.
      <tag><ref id="utility-brltty-config" name="brltty-config"></tag>
        A utility which sets a number of environment variables to values
        which reflect the current installation of BRLTTY.
    </descrip>
  <tag>/etc/</>
    <descrip>
      <tag/brltty.conf/
        System defaults for BRLTTY.
      <tag/brlapi.key/
        The access key for BrlAPI.
    </descrip>
  <tag>/etc/brltty/</>
    Your installation of BRLTTY may not have all of the following types of files.
    They're only created as needed based on the build options you select
    (see <ref id="build" name="Build Options">).
    <descrip>
      <tag/*.conf/
        Driver-specific configuration data.
        Their names look more or less like <tt/brltty-/<em/driver/<tt/.conf/,
        where <em/driver/ is the two-letter <ref id="drivers" name="driver identification code">.
      <tag/*.ctb/
        Contraction tables
        (see section <ref id="contraction" name="Contracted Braille"> for details).
        Their names look like <em/language/<tt/-/<em/country/<tt/-/<em/level/<tt/.ctb/.
      <tag/*.cti/
        Include files for contraction tables.
      <tag/*.hlp/
        Driver-specific help pages.

      <tag/*.tbl/
        Translation tables
        (see section <ref id="translation" name="Translation Tables"> for details).
        Their names look like <tt/text./<em/language/<tt/.tbl/.
        There are also a couple of special tables which map
        character highlighting attributes to braille dots:
        <tt/attrib.tbl/ does it the original way,
        and <tt/attributes.tbl/ does it the current way.
    </descrip>
  <tag>/lib/</>
    <descrip>
      <tag/libbrlapi.a/
        Static archive of the Application Programming Interface.
      <tag/libbrlapi.so/
        Dynamically loadable object for the Application Programming Interface.
    </descrip>
  <tag>/lib/brltty/</>
    Your installation of BRLTTY may not have all of the following types of files.
    They're only created as needed based on the build options you select
    (see <ref id="build" name="Build Options">).
    <descrip>
      <tag/brltty-brl.lst/
        A list of the braille display drivers which have been built
        as dynamically loadable shared objects,
        and, therefore, which can be selected at run-time.
        Each line consists of
        the two-letter identification code for a driver,
        a tab character,
        and a description of the braille display which that driver is for.
      <tag>libbrlttyb<em/driver/.so.1</tag>
        The dynamically loadable driver for a braille display,
        where <em/driver/ is the two-letter <ref id="drivers" name="driver identification code">.
      <tag/brltty-spk.lst/
        A list of the speech synthesizer drivers which have been built
        as dynamically loadable shared objects,
        and, therefore, which can be selected at run-time.
        Each line consists of
        the two-letter identification code for a driver,
        a tab character,
        and a description of the speech synthesizer which that driver is for.

        Man pages for BRLTTY-related user commands.
      <tag>man3/<em/name/.3</tag>
        Man pages for Application Programming Interface library routines.
    </descrip>
</descrip>

Some optional files which you should be aware of,
although they aren't part of the installed file hierarchy, are:
<descrip>
  <tag>/etc/brltty.conf</tag>
    The system defaults configuration file.
    It's created by the system administrator.
    See <ref id="configure" name="The Configuration File"> for details.
  <tag>/etc/brltty-<em/driver/.prefs</tag>
    The saved preferences settings file
    (<em/driver/ is a two-letter <ref id="drivers" name="driver identification code">).
    It's created by the <ref id="command-PREFSAVE" name="PREFSAVE"> command.
    See <ref id="preferences" name="Preferences Settings"> for details.
</descrip>

<sect1>Installing from a TAR Ball<label id="tar"><p>
Here's what to do if you just want to install BRLTTY as quickly as possible,
trusting that all of our defaults are correct.
<enum>
  <item>
    Download the source.
    It'll be a file named
    <tt/brltty-/<em/release/<tt/.tar.gz/,
    e.g. <tt/brltty-3.0.tar.gz/.
  <item>
    Unpack the source into its native hierarchical structure.
    <tscreen>tar xzf brltty-<em/release/.tar.gz</tscreen>
    This should create the directory <tt/brltty-/<em/release/.
  <item>
    Change to the source directory, configure, compile, and install BRLTTY.
    <tscreen>
      cd brltty-<em/release/
      <newline>
      ./configure
      <newline>
      make install
    </tscreen>
    This should be done as <bf/root/.
</enum>

To uninstall BRLTTY, do:
<tscreen>
  cd brltty-<em/release/
  <newline>
  make uninstall
</tscreen>

That's all there's to it.
Now, for those who really want to know what's going on, here are the details.

<sect2>Build Options<label id="build"><p>
The first step in building BRLTTY is to configure it
for your system and/or for your personal needs.
This is done by running the <tt/configure/ script in BRLTTY's top-level directory.
We've tried to make the defaults fit the most common case, so,
assuming that you're not attempting to do anything out of the ordinary,
you may not need to do anything more complicated than
invoke this script without specifying any options at all.
<tscreen>./configure</tscreen>
If, however, you have some special requirements,
or even if you're just adventurous,
you should find out what your choices are.
<tscreen>./configure --help</tscreen>
You should also check out the <tt/README/ file in the subdirectory
containing the driver for your braille display
for any additional display-specific instructions.

<sect3>System Defaults<label id="build-defaults"><p>
<descrip>
  <tag><tt/--with-braille-driver=/<em/driver/<label id="build-braille-driver"></tag>
    Specify the braille display drivers
    which are to be linked into the BRLTTY binary.
    Each driver must be identified
    either by its two-letter <ref id="drivers" name="driver identification code">
    or by its proper name (full or abbreviated).
    The driver identifiers and/or names must be
    separated from one another by a single comma.
    The first one becomes the default driver.
    There's no default driver if this option isn't used.
    Those drivers which aren't listed via this option
    are built as dynamically loadable shared objects
    and can still be selected at run-time.
    Any of the following words can also be used as the operand of this option:
    <descrip>
      <tag/all/
        Link all of the drivers into the binary.
        Don't build any of them as dynamically loadable shared objects.
        This word may also be specified as the final element of a driver list.
        This is how to specify the dfault driver when all the drivers are to be linked in.
      <tag/no/
        Don't build any drivers at all.
        This is equivalent to specifying <tt/--without-braille-driver/.
      <tag/yes/
        Build all of the drivers as dynamically loadable shared objects.
        Don't link any of them into the binary.
        This is equivalent to specifying <tt/--with-braille-driver/.
    </descrip>
    See the <ref id="configure-braille-driver" name="braille-driver"> configuration file directive

  <tag><tt/--with-braille-device=/<em/device/<label id="build-braille-device"></tag>
    Specify the default device to which the braille display is connected.
    If a relative path is supplied, then it's anchored at <tt>/dev</>.
    If this option isn't specified,
    then an operating system appropriate path
    for the primary serial port is assumed.
    See the <ref id="configure-braille-device" name="braille-device"> configuration file directive
    and the <ref id="options-braille-device" name="-d"> command line option
    for run-time selection.
  <tag><tt/--with-text-table=/<em/file/<label id="build-text-table"></tag>
    Specify the default text translation table
    (see section <ref id="translation" name="Translation Tables"> for details).
    If a relative path is supplied, then it's anchored at <tt>/etc/brltty</>
    (see the <ref id="build-data-directory" name="--sysconfdir">
    and the <ref id="build-execute-root" name="--with-execute-root">
    build options for more details).
    The <tt/.tbl/ extension is optional.
    For a simple file name, the <tt/text./ prefix is optional.
    If this option isn't specified,
    then <tt/nabcc/,
    a commonly (in North America) used 8-dot variant of the
    <ref id="nabcc" name="North American Braille Computer Code">,
    is assumed.
    See the <ref id="configure-text-table" name="text-table"> configuration file directive
    and the <ref id="options-text-table" name="-t"> command line option
    for run-time selection.
    This setting can be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-text-table" name="Text Table"> preference.
  <tag><tt/--with-attributes-table=/<em/file/<label id="build-attributes-table"></tag>
    Specify the default attributes translation table
    (see section <ref id="translation" name="Translation Tables"> for details).
    If a relative path is supplied, then it's anchored at <tt>/etc/brltty</>
    (see the <ref id="build-data-directory" name="--sysconfdir">
    and the <ref id="build-execute-root" name="--with-execute-root">
    build options for more details).
    The <tt/.tbl/ extension is optional.
    If this option isn't specified,
    then <tt/attributes/ is assumed.
    Change it to <tt/attrib/ if you'd like it done the old way.
    See the <ref id="configure-attributes-table" name="attributes-table"> configuration file directive
    and the <ref id="options-attributes-table" name="-a"> command line option
    for run-time selection.
    This setting can be changed with the

        <tt>/usr/local</>,
        or <tt>/opt/viavoice</>.
        This is equivalent to specifying <tt/--with-viavoice/.
    </descrip>
  <tag><tt/--with-screen-driver=/<em/driver/<label id="build-screen-driver"></tag>
    Specify the screen driver.
    It may be one of the following:
    <descrip>
      <tag/linux/
        This driver provides direct access to the Linux console screen.
        It's only selectable, and is the default, on Linux systems.
      <tag/shm/
        This driver provides access to the <tt/screen/ program.
        It's selectable on all systems,
        and is the default on most.
        The patch for <tt/screen/ which we provide
        (see the <tt/Patches/ subdirectory)
        must be applied.
        Use of this driver,
        due to the fact that <tt/screen/ must be concurrently running,
        makes BRLTTY effectively useful only after the user has logged in.
    </descrip>
    If this option isn't specified,
    then an operating system appropriate selection is made.
    If a specific driver for the current operating system is available,
    then it's used.
    If not, then <tt/shm/ is used.

<sect3>Miscellaneous Options<label id="build-miscellaneous"><p>
<descrip>
  <tag><tt/--with-compiler-prefix=/<em/prefix/<label id="build-compiler-prefix"></tag>
    Specify the prefix (path and beginning of program name)
    for the suite of compile and link tools which are to be used.
    You may need to use this option if, for example,
    you're cross-compiling for a different architecture.
  <tag><tt/--with-init-path=/<em/path/<label id="build-init-path"></tag>
    Specify the path to the real <tt/init/ program for the system.
    The absolute path should be supplied.
    If this option is specified, then:
    <enum>
      <item>
        The <tt/init/ program should be moved to a new location.
      <item>
        <tt/brltty/ should be moved to the <tt/init/ program's original location.
      <item>
        When the system runs <tt/init/ at startup,
        <tt/brltty/ is actually run.
        It puts itself into the background,
        and runs the real <tt/init/ in the foreground.
        This is one (somewhat sneaky) way to have braille right at the outset.
        It's especially useful for some install/rescue disks.
    </enum>
    If this option isn't specified, then this feature isn't activated.
</descrip>

<sect2>Make File Targets<label id="make"><p>
Once BRLTTY has been configured,
the next steps are to compile and to install it.
These are done by applying the system's <tt/make/ command
to BRLTTY's main make file (<tt/Makefile/ in the top-level directory).
BRLTTY's make file supports most of the common application maintenance targets.
They include:
<descrip>
  <tag/make/
    A shortcut for <tt/make all/.
  <tag>make all<label id="make-all"></tag>
    Compile and link the BRLTTY executable, its drivers and their help pages,
    its test programs, and a few other small utilities.
  <tag>make install<label id="make-install"></tag>
    Complete the compile and link phase
    (see <ref id="make-all" name="make all">),
    and then install the BRLTTY executable, its data files, drivers, and help pages,
    in the correct places and with the correct permissions.
  <tag>make uninstall<label id="make-uninstall"></tag>
    Remove the BRLTTY executable, its data files, drivers, and help pages,
    from the system.
  <tag>make clean<label id="make-clean"></tag>
    Ensure that the next compile and link
    (see <ref id="make-all" name="make all">)
    will be done from scratch by removing the results of
    compiling, linking, and testing from the source directory structure.
    This includes the removal of object files, executables,
    dynamically loadable shared objects, driver lists, help pages,
    temporary header files, and core files.
  <tag>make distclean<label id="make-distclean"></tag>
    In addition to removing the results of compiling and linking
    (see <ref id="make-clean" name="make clean">):
    <itemize>
      <item>
        Remove the results of BRLTTY configuration
        (see <ref id="build" name="Build Options">).
        This includes the removal of
        <tt/config.mk/, <tt/config.h/,
        <tt/config.cache/, <tt/config.status/, and <tt/config.log/.
      <item>
        Remove other files from the source directory structure
        which tend to accumulate over time but which don't belong there.
        This includes the removal of
        editor backup files, test case results,
        rejected patch hunks, and copies of original source files.
    </itemize>
</descrip>

<sect1>Testing BRLTTY<p>
After compiling, linking, and installing BRLTTY,
it's a good idea to give it a quick test before activating it permanently.
To do so, invoke it with the command:
<tscreen>brltty -b<em/driver/ -d<em/device/</tscreen>
For <em/driver/, specify the two-letter
<ref id="drivers" name="driver identification code">
corresponding to your braille display.
For <em/device/, specify the full path
for the device to which your braille display is connected.

If you don't want to explicitly identify the driver and device
each time you start BRLTTY, then you can take two approaches.
You can establish system defaults
via the <ref id="configure-braille-driver" name="braille-driver">
and the <ref id="configure-braille-device" name="braille-device">
configuration file directives,
and/or compile your needs right into BRLTTY
via the <ref id="build-braille-driver" name="--with-braille-driver">
and the <ref id="build-braille-device" name="--with-braille-device">
build options.

If all is well, BRLTTY's version identification message
should appear on the braille display for a few seconds
(see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option).
After it goes away (which you can hasten by pressing any key on the display),
the area of the screen where the cursor is should appear.
This means that you should expect to see your shell's command prompt.
Then, as you enter your next command,
each character should appear on the display as it's typed on the keyboard.

If this is your experience, then leave BRLTTY running, and enjoy it.
If this isn't your experience, then it may be necessary
to test each driver separately in order to isolate the source of the probledm.
The screen driver can be tested with <ref id="utility-scrtest" name="scrtest">,
and the braille display driver can be tested with <ref id="utility-brltest" name="brltest">.

If you experience a problem which requires a lot of digging,
then you may wish to use the following <tt/brltty/ command line options:
<itemize>
  <item>
    <ref id="options-log-level" name="-ldebug">
    to log lots of diagnostic messages.
  <item>
    <ref id="options-no-daemon" name="-n">
    to keep BRLTTY in the foreground.
  <item>
    <ref id="options-standard-error" name="-e">
    to direct diagnostic messages to standard error
    rather than to the system log.
</itemize>

<sect1>Starting BRLTTY<p>
BRLTTY, when properly installed, is invoked with the single command <tt/brltty/.
A configuration file
(see section <ref id="configure" name="The Configuration File"> for details)
can be created in order to establish system defaults for such things as
the location of the preferences file,
the braille display driver to be used,
the device to which the braille display is connected,
and the text translation table to be used.
Many options
(see section <ref id="options" name="Command Line Options"> for details)
allow explicit run-time specification of such things as
the location of the configuration file,
any defaults established within the configuration file,
and some characteristics which have reasonable defaults
but which those who think they know what they're doing may wish to play with.
The <ref id="options-help" name="-h"> option
displays a summary of all the options.
The <ref id="options-version" name="-v"> option
displays the current version of the program and the selected drivers.

It's probably best to have the system automatically start BRLTTY
as part of the boot sequence
so that the braille display is already up and running when the login prompt appears.
Most (probably all) distributions provide a script wherein
user-supplied applications can be safely started near the end of the boot sequence.
The name of this script is distribution-dependent.
Here are the ones we know about so far:
<descrip>
  <tag/Red Hat/
    <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</>
</descrip>

Starting BRLTTY from this script is a good approach (especially for new users).
Just add a set of lines like these:
<tscreen><verb>
if [ -x /bin/brltty -a -f /etc/brltty.conf ]
then
   /bin/brltty
fi
</verb></tscreen>
This can usually be abbreviated to the somewhat less readable form:
<tscreen><verb>
[ -x /bin/brltty -a -f /etc/brltty.conf ] && /bin/brltty
</verb></tscreen>
Don't add these lines before the first line
(which usually looks like <tt>&num;!/bin/sh</>).

If the braille display is to be used by a system administrator,
then it should probably be started as early as possible during the boot sequence
(like before the file systems are checked)
so that the display is usable
in the event that something goes wrong during these checks
and the system drops into single user mode.
Again, exactly where it's best to do this is distribution-dependent.
Here are the places we know about so far:
<descrip>
  <tag>Debian</tag>
    <tt>/etc/init.d/boot</> (for older releases)
    <newline>
    <tt>/etc/init.d/rcS</> (for newer releases)
    <newline>
    A <tt/brltty/ package is provided
    (see [<htmlurl url="http://packages.debian.org/brltty" name="http://packages.debian.org/brltty">])
    as of release <tt/3.0/ (<tt/Woody/).
    Since this package takes care of starting BRLTTY,
    there's no need for user-supplied code to do so if it's installed.
  <tag>RedHat</tag>
    <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</>
    <newline>
    Beware that later releases,
    in order to support a more user-oriented system initialization procedure,
    have this script reinvoke itself such that
    it's under the control of <tt/initlog/.
    Look, probably right up near the top, for a set of lines like these:
    <tscreen><verb>
    # Rerun ourselves through initlog
    if [ -z "$IN_INITLOG" ]; then
      [ -f /sbin/initlog ] && exec /sbin/initlog $INITLOG_ARGS -r /etc/rc.sysinit
    fi
    </verb></tscreen>
    Starting BRLTTY before this reinvocation
    results in two BRLTTY processes running at the same time,
    and that'll give you no end of problems.
    If your version of this script has this feature,
    then make sure you start BRLTTY after the lines which implement it.
  <tag>Slackware</tag>
    <tt>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</>
  <tag>SuSE</tag>
    <tt>/sbin/init.d/boot</>
</descrip>

An alternative is to start BRLTTY from <tt>/etc/inittab</>.
You have two choices if you choose this route.
<itemize>
  <item>
    If you want it to be started really early
    but don't need it to be automatially restarted if it dies,
    then add a line like this before the first <tt/:sysinit:/ line which is already in there.
    <tscreen>brl::sysinit:/bin/brltty</tscreen>
  <item>
    If you don't mind it being started later
    but do want it to be automatially restarted if it dies,
    then add a line like this anywhere within the file.
    <tscreen>brl:12345:respawn:/bin/brltty -n</tscreen>
    The <ref id="options-no-daemon" name="-n"> (<tt/--nodaemon/) option is very
    important when running BRLTTY with <bf/init/'s <tt/respawn/ facility.
    You'll end up with hundreds of BRLTTY processes all running at the same time
    if you forget to specify it.
</itemize>
Check that the identifier (<tt/bt/ in these examples)
isn't already being used by another entry,
and, if it is, choose a different one which isn't.

Note that a command like <tt/kill -TERM/
is sufficient to stop BRLTTY in its tracks.
If it dies during entry into single user mode, for example,
it may well be due to a problem of this nature.

Some systems experience problems if an application tries to use
the kernel's sound subsystem before it has been initialized.
If your system is one of them, then
you may need to disable the automatic starting of the speech synthesizer driver
with the <ref id="options-no-speech" name="-N"> option.

Some systems, as part of the boot sequence, probe the serial ports
(usually in order to automatically find the mouse and deduce its type).
If your braille display is using a serial port,
this kind of probing may be enough to get it confused.
If this happens to you, then try restarting the braille driver
(see the <ref id="command-RESTARTBRL" name="RESTARTBRL"> command).
Better yet, turn off the serial port probing.
Here's what we know so far about how to do this:
<descrip>
  <tag/Red Hat/
    The probing is done by a service named <tt/kudzu/.
    Use the command <tscreen>chkconfig --list kudzu</tscreen> to see if it's been enabled.
    Use the command <tscreen>chkconfig kudzu off</tscreen> to disable it.
    Later releases allow you to let <tt/kudzu/ run
    without probing the serial ports.
    To do this, edit the file <tt>/etc/sysconfig/kudzu</>,
    and set <tt/SAFE/ to <tt/yes/.
</descrip>

If you want to start BRLTTY before any file systems are mounted, then
ensure that all of its components are installed within the root file system.

BRLTTY needs to run with root privileges because it needs
read and write access for the port to which the braille display is connected,
read access to <tt>/dev/vcsa</> or equivalent
(to query the screen dimensions and the cursor position,
and to review the current screen content and highlighting),
and read and write access to the system console
(for arrow key entry during cursor routing,
for input character insertion during paste,
for special key simulation using keys on the braille display,
for retrieving output character translation and screen font mapping tables,
and for activation of the internal beeper).
Access to the needed devices can, of course, be granted to a non-root user
by changing the file permissions associated with the devices.
Merely having access to the console, however, isn't enough because
activating the internal beeper and simulating key strokes still require root privilege.
So, if you're willing to give up cursor routing, cut&amp;paste, beeps,
and all that, you can run BRLTTY without root priviledge.

<sect1>Installing from an RPM File<label id="rpm"><p>
To install BRLTTY from an RPM (RedHat Package Manager) file, do the following:
<enum>
  <item>
    Download the binary package which corresponds to your hardware.
    It'll be a file named
    <tt/brltty-/<em/release/<tt/-/<em/version/<tt/./<em/architecture/<tt/.rpm/,
    e.g. <tt/brltty-3.0-1.i386.rpm/.
  <item>
    Install the package.
    <tscreen>rpm -Uvh brltty-<em/release/-<em/version/.<em/architecture/.rpm</tscreen>
    This should be done as <bf/root/.
    Strictly speaking, the <tt/-U/ (update) option is the only one which is necessary.
    The <tt/-v/ (verbose) option displays the name of the package as it's being installed.
    The <tt/-h/ (hashes) option displays a progress meter (using hash signs).
</enum>
For the brave,
we also provide the source RPM (<tt/.src.rpm/) file,
but that's beyond the scope of this document.

To uninstall BRLTTY, do:
<tscreen>rpm -e brltty</tscreen>

<sect1>Other Utilities<p>
Building BRLTTY also results in the building of
a few small helper and diagnostic utilities.

<sect2>brltty-install<label id="utility-brltty-install"><p>
This utility copies BRLTTY's
<ref id="hierarchy" name="installed file hierarchy">
from one location to another.
<tscreen>brltty-install <em/to/ &lsqb;<em/from/&rsqb;</tscreen>
<descrip>
  <tag><em/to/</tag>
    The location to which the
    <ref id="hierarchy" name="installed file hierarchy">
    is to be copied.
    It must be an existing directory.
  <tag><em/from/</tag>
    The location from which the
    <ref id="hierarchy" name="installed file hierarchy">
    is to be taken.
    If it's specified, then it must be an existing directory.
    If it's not specified, then the location used for the build is assumed.
</descrip>

This utility can be used, for example, to copy BRLTTY to a root disk.
If a root floppy is mounted as <tt>/mnt</>,
and BRLTTY is installed on the main system,
then typing <tscreen>brltty-install /mnt</tscreen>
copies BRLTTY, along with all of its data and library files,
to the root floppy.

Some problems have been experienced when copying BRLTTY
between systems with different versions of the shared C library.
This is worth investigating if you have difficulties.

<sect2>brltty-config<label id="utility-brltty-config"><p>
This utility sets a number of environment variables to values
which reflect the current installation of BRLTTY
(see <ref id="build" name="Build Options">).

<sect>Using BRLTTY<p>
Before starting BRLTTY, you need to set up your braille display.
In most cases this is done simply
by connecting it to an available serial port,
and then turning it on.
After your display has been set up,
run BRLTTY simply by typing the command <tt/brltty/ at a shell prompt
(this must be done as root).
Check the
<ref id="options-braille-device" name="-d"> command line option,
the <ref id="configure-braille-device" name="braille-device"> configuration file directive,
and the <ref id="build-braille-device" name="--with-braille-device"> build option
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which device your display is connected to.
Check the
<ref id="options-braille-driver" name="-b"> command line option,
the <ref id="configure-braille-driver" name="braille-driver"> configuration file directive,
and the <ref id="build-braille-driver" name="--with-braille-driver"> build option
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which kind of braille display you have.
Check the
<ref id="options-braille-parameters" name="-B"> command line option,
and the <ref id="configure-braille-parameters" name="braille-parameters"> configuration file directive
for alternatives regarding how to pass parameters to the driver for your braille display.

A message giving the program name (BRLTTY) and its version number
will appear briefly
(see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option)
on the braille display.
The display will then show a small area of the screen including the cursor.
By default, the cursor is represented as
dots 7 and 8 superimposed on the character it is on.

Any screen activity will be reflected on the braille display.
The display will also follow the progress of the cursor on the screen.  
This feature is known as <bf/cursor tracking/.

Just typing on the keyboard and reading the display, however, isn't enough.
Try entering a command which will cause an error, and pressing <bf/enter/.  
The error appears on the screen, but, unless you have a multi-line display,
the chances are that it isn't visible on the braille display.
All you see thereon is another shell prompt.
What's needed, then, is some way to move
the braille <em/window/ around the screen.
The keys on the braille display itself can be used to send commands to BRLTTY
which, in addition to a lot of other things, can also do exactly that.

<sect1>Commands<p>
Unfortunately, the various braille displays don't offer a standard set of controls.
Some have the six standard dot keys, some have eight, and others have none.
Some have thumb keys, but there's no standard number of them.
Some have a button above each braille cell.
Some have rocker switches.
Some have an easy-to-reach bar which works much like a joystick.
Most have varying combinations of the above.
Because the nature and layout of each display is so different,
please refer to the documentation for your particular display
in order to find out exactly what its keys do.

BRLTTY commands are referred to by name within this manual.
If you forget which key(s) on your braille display to use
for a paticular command, then refer to its driver's help page.
The main key you should immediately commit to memory, therefore, is the one
for the <ref id="command-HELP" name="HELP"> command.
Use the regular motion keys (as described below) to navigate the help page,
and press the <tt/help/ key again to quit.

  <tag>CHRLT<label id="command-CHRLT"></tag>
    Go left one character.
  <tag>CHRRT<label id="command-CHRRT"></tag>
    Go right one character.
  <tag>HWINLT<label id="command-HWINLT"></tag>
    Go left half a window.
  <tag>HWINRT<label id="command-HWINRT"></tag>
    Go right half a window.
  <tag>FWINLT<label id="command-FWINLT"></tag>
    Go left one window.
    This command is particularly useful when reading backward
    because it automatically wraps up to the end of the previous line
    when invoked at the beginning of the current line.
    Other features like its ability to skip blank windows
    (see the <ref id="command-SKPBLNKWINS" name="SKPBLNKWINS"> command)
    further enhance its usefulness for this purpose.
  <tag>FWINRT<label id="command-FWINRT"></tag>
    Go right one window.
    This command is particularly useful when reading forward
    because it automatically wraps down to the beginning of the next line
    when invoked at the end of the current line.
    Other features like its ability to skip blank windows
    (see the <ref id="command-SKPBLNKWINS" name="SKPBLNKWINS"> command)

<descrip>
  <tag>HOME<label id="command-HOME"></tag>
    Go to where the cursor is.
  <tag>BACK<label id="command-BACK"></tag>
    Go back to where the most recent motion command put the braille window.
    This is an easy way to get right back to where you were reading
    after an unexpected event (like cursor tracking)
    moves the braille window at an inopportune moment.
</descrip>

<sect2>Feature Activation<p>
Each of these commands has three forms:
<bf/activate/ (turn the feature on),
<bf/deactivate/ (turn the feature off),
and <bf/toggle/ (if it's off then turn it on, and if it's on then turn it off).
Unless specifically noted, each of these features
is initially <bf/off/, and, when <bf/on/, affects BRLTTY's operation as a whole.
The initial setting of some of these features can be changed
via the <ref id="preferences-menu" name="preferences menu">.
<descrip>
  <tag>FREEZE<label id="command-FREEZE"></tag>
    Freeze the screen image.
    BRLTTY makes a copy of the screen (content and attributes)
    as of the moment when the screen image is frozen,
    and then ignores all updating of the screen until it's unfrozen.
    This feature makes it easy, for example,
    to sample the output of an application which writes too much too quickly.
  <tag>DISPMD<label id="command-DISPMD"></tag>
    Show the highlighting (the attributes)
    of each character within the braille window,
    rather than the characters themselves (the content).
    This feature is useful, for example,
    when you need to locate a highlighted item.
    When showing screen content, the text translation table is used
    (see the <ref id="options-text-table" name="-t"> command line option,
    the <ref id="configure-text-table" name="text-table"> configuration file directive,
    and the <ref id="build-text-table" name="--with-text-table"> build option).
    When showing screen attributes, the attributes translation table is used
    (see the <ref id="options-attributes-table" name="-a"> command line option,
    the <ref id="configure-attributes-table" name="attributes-table"> configuration file directive,
    and the <ref id="build-attributes-table" name="--with-attributes-table"> build option).
    This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
  <tag>SIXDOTS<label id="command-SIXDOTS"></tag>
    Show characters using 6-dot, rather than 8-dot, braille.
    Dots 7 and 8 are still used by other features
    like cursor representation and highlighted character underlining.
    If a contraction table has been selected
    (see the <ref id="options-contraction-table" name="-c"> command line option
    and the <ref id="configure-contraction-table" name="contraction-table"> configuration file directive),
    then it is used.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-text-style" name="Text Style"> preference.
  <tag>SLIDEWIN<label id="command-SLIDEWIN"></tag>
    If cursor tracking
    (see the <ref id="command-CSRTRK" name="CSRTRK"> command)
    is <bf/on/, then,
    whenever the cursor moves too close to (or beyond)
    either end of the braille window,
    horizontally reposition the window such that the cursor,
    while remaining on that side, is nearer the centre.
    If this feature is <bf/off/,
    then the braille window is always positioned such that
    its left end is a multiple of its width from the left edge of the screen.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-sliding-window" name="Sliding Window"> preference.
  <tag>SKPIDLNS<label id="command-SKPIDLNS"></tag>
    Rather than explicitly moving exactly one line either up or down,
    skip passed lines which have the same content as the current line.
    This feature affects the <ref id="command-LNUP" name="LNUP">
    and <ref id="command-LNDN" name="LNDN"> commands,
    as well as the line wrapping feature of
    the <ref id="command-FWINLT" name="FWINLT">,
    <ref id="command-FWINRT" name="FWINRT">,
    <ref id="command-FWINLTSKIP" name="FWINLTSKIP">,
    and <ref id="command-FWINRTSKIP" name="FWINRTSKIP"> commands.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-skip-identical-lines" name="Skip Identical Lines"> preference.
  <tag>SKPBLNKWINS<label id="command-SKPBLNKWINS"></tag>
    Skip passed blank windows when reading either forward or backward.
    This feature affects the <ref id="command-FWINLT" name="FWINLT">
    and <ref id="command-FWINRT" name="FWINRT"> commands.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-skip-blank-windows" name="Skip Blank Windows"> preference.
  <tag>CSRVIS<label id="command-CSRVIS"></tag>
    Show the cursor by superimposing a dot pattern
    (see the <ref id="command-CSRSIZE" name="CSRSIZE"> command)
    on top of the character where it is.
    This feature is initially <bf/on/.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-show-cursor" name="Show Cursor"> preference.
  <tag>CSRHIDE<label id="command-CSRHIDE"></tag>
    Hide the cursor (see the <ref id="command-CSRVIS" name="CSRVIS"> command)
    in order to accurately read the character beneath it.
    This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
  <tag>CSRTRK<label id="command-CSRTRK"></tag>
    Track (follow) the cursor.
    If the cursor moves to a location which isn't within the braille window,
    then automatically move the braille window to the cursor's new location.
    You'll usually want this feature turned on
    since it minimizes the effects of screen scrolling,
    and since, during input, the region wherein you're currently typing is always visible.
    If this feature causes the braille window to jump at an inopportune moment,
    then use the <ref id="command-BACK" name="BACK"> command
    to get back to where you were reading.
   You may need to turn this feature off when using an application which
   continually updates the screen while maintaining a fixed data layout.
    This feature is initially <bf/on/.
    This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
  <tag>CSRSIZE<label id="command-CSRSIZE"></tag>
    Represent the cursor with all eight dots (a solid block),
    rather than with just dots 7 and 8 (an underline).
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-cursor-style" name="Cursor Style"> preference.
  <tag>CSRBLINK<label id="command-CSRBLINK"></tag>
    Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
    the symbol representing the cursor
    (see the <ref id="command-CSRVIS" name="CSRVIS"> command).
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-blinking-cursor" name="Blinking Cursor"> preference.
  <tag>ATTRVIS<label id="command-ATTRVIS"></tag>
    Underline (with combinations of dots 7 and 8) highlighted characters.
    <descrip>
      <tag/no underline/
        White on black (normal),
        gray on black,

    </descrip>
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-show-attributes" name="Show Attributes"> preference.
  <tag>ATTRBLINK<label id="command-ATTRBLINK"></tag>
    Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
    the attribute underline
    (see the <ref id="command-ATTRVIS" name="ATTRVIS"> command).
    This feature is initially <bf/on/.
    This setting can also be changed with the
    <ref id="preference-blinking-attributes" name="Blinking Attributes"> preference.
  <tag>CAPBLINK<label id="command-CAPBLINK"></tag>

<sect2>Other Commands<p>
<descrip>
  <tag>CSRJMP_VERT<label id="command-CSRJMP_VERT"></tag>
    Route (bring) the cursor to anywhere on the top line of the braille window
    (see <ref id="routing" name="Cursor Routing"> for full details).
    The cursor is moved by simulating vertical arrow-key presses.
    This command doesn't always work because some applications
    either move the cursor somewhat unpredictably
    or use the arrow keys for purposes other than cursor motion.
    It's somewhat safer than the other cursor routing commands, though,
    because it makes no attempt to simulate the left- and right-arrows.
  <tag>PASTE<label id="command-PASTE"></tag>
    Insert the characters within the cut buffer at the current cursor location
    (see <ref id="cut" name="Cut and Paste"> for full details).
  <tag>RESTARTBRL<label id="command-RESTARTBRL"></tag>
    Stop, and then restart the braille display driver.
  <tag>RESTARTSPEECH<label id="command-RESTARTSPEECH"></tag>
    Stop, and then restart the speech synthesizer driver.
</descrip>

<sect2>Routing Keys<p>
<descrip>
  <tag>ROUTE<label id="command-ROUTE"></tag>
    Route (bring) the cursor to the character
    associated with the routing key
    (see <ref id="routing" name="Cursor Routing"> for full details).
    The cursor is moved by simulating arrow-key presses.
    This command doesn't always work because some applications
    either move the cursor somewhat unpredictably
    or use the arrow keys for purposes other than cursor motion.
  <tag>CUTBEGIN<label id="command-CUTBEGIN"></tag>
    Anchor the start of the cut block at the character
    associated with the routing key
    (see <ref id="cut" name="Cut and Paste"> for full details).
    This command clears the cut buffer.
  <tag>CUTAPPEND<label id="command-CUTAPPEND"></tag>
    Anchor the start of the cut block at the character
    associated with the routing key
    (see <ref id="cut" name="Cut and Paste"> for full details).
    This command doesn't clear the cut buffer.
  <tag>CUTRECT<label id="command-CUTRECT"></tag>
    Anchor the end of the cut block at the character
    associated with the routing key,
    and append the rectangular region to the cut buffer
    (see <ref id="cut" name="Cut and Paste"> for full details).
  <tag>CUTLINE<label id="command-CUTLINE"></tag>
    Anchor the end of the cut block at the character
    associated with the routing key,
    and append the linear region to the cut buffer
    (see <ref id="cut" name="Cut and Paste"> for full details).
  <tag>SWITCHVT<label id="command-SWITCHVT"></tag>
    Switch to the virtual terminal whose number
    (counting from 1) matches that of the routing key.
  <tag>PRINDENT<label id="command-PRINDENT"></tag>
    Go up to the nearest previous line which isn't indented
    more than the column associated with the routing key.
  <tag>NXINDENT<label id="command-NXINDENT"></tag>
    Go down to the nearest next line which isn't indented
    more than the column associated with the routing key.
  <tag>DESCCHAR<label id="command-DESCCHAR"></tag>
    Momentarily (see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option)
    display a message describing the character associated with the routing key.
    It reveals
    the decimal and hexadecimal values of the character,
    the foreground and background colours,
    and, when present, special attributes (<tt/bright/ and <tt/blink/).
    The message looks like this:
    <tscreen>char 65 (0x41): white on black bright blink</tscreen>
  <tag>SETLEFT<label id="command-SETLEFT"></tag>
    Horizontally reposition the braille window so that
    its left edge is at the column associated with the routing key.
    This feature makes it very easy to put the window exactly where it's needed,
    and, therefore, for displays which have routing keys,
    almost eliminates the need for a lot of elementary window motion
    (like the <ref id="command-CHRLT" name="CHRLT">,
    <ref id="command-CHRRT" name="CHRRT">,
    <ref id="command-HWINLT" name="HWINLT">,
    and <ref id="command-HWINRT" name="HWINRT"> commands).
  <tag>SETMARK<label id="command-SETMARK"></tag>
    Mark (remember) the current position of the braille window
    in a register associated with the routing key.
    See the <ref id="command-GOTOMARK" name="GOTOMARK"> command.
    This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
  <tag>GOTOMARK<label id="command-GOTOMARK"></tag>
    Move the braille window to the position formerly marked
    (see the <ref id="command-SETMARK" name="SETMARK"> command)
    with the same routing key.
    This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.

<sect>Feature Descriptions<p>

<sect1>Cursor Routing<label id="routing"><p>
When moving the braille window around the screen
while examining the text, say, in an editor,
you often need to bring the cursor
to a specific character within the braille window.
You'll probably find this to be a rather difficult task for a number of reasons.
One is that you may not know where the cursor is,
and that you may lose your place while trying to find it.
Another is that the cursor may move unrpedictably as the arrow keys are pressed
(some editors, for example, don't allow the cursor to be
more to the right than the end of the line it's on).
Cursor routing provides just such a capability
by knowing where the cursor is,
by simulating the same arrow-key presses which you'd have to enter manually,
and by monitoring the progress of the cursor as it moves.

Some braille displays have a button, known as a routing key, above each cell.
These keys use the <ref id="command-ROUTE" name="ROUTE"> command
to route the cursor right to the desired location.

Cursor routing, while very convenient and effective,
is, strictly speaking, not completely reliable.
One reason for this is that its current implementation assumes
VT100 cursor key escape sequences.
Another is that some applications do non-standard things
in response to detecting that a cursor key has been pressed.
A minor problem found within some editors (like <tt/vi/),
as already mentioned above,
is that they throw in some unpredictable horizontal motion
when vertical motion is requested
because they don't allow the cursor to be to the right of the end of a line.
A major problem found within some web browsers (like <tt/lynx/)
is that the up- and down-arrow keys are used to move among the links
(which may skip lines and/or move the cursor horizontally,
but which rarely just moves the cursor one line in the desired direction),
and that the left- and right-arrow keys are used to select links
(which has absolutely nothing to do with any form of cursor motion whatsoever,
and which even totally changes the screen content).

Cursor routing may not work very well on a heavily loaded system,
and definitely doesn't work very well when working on a remote system over a slow link.
This is so because of all of the checks which must be made along the way
in order to deal with unpredictable cursor motion
and in order to ensure that any mistake has at least a fighting chance to be undone.
Even  though BRLTTY tries to be fairly clever,
it must still essentially wait to see what happens after each simulated arrow-key press.

Once a cursor routing request has been made,
BRLTTY keeps trying to route the cursor to the desired location until
a timeout expires before the cursor reaches that location,
the cursor seems to be moving in the wrong direction,
or you switch to a different virtual terminal.
An attempt is first made to use virtical motion
to bring the cursor to the right line,
and, only if that succeeds, an attempt is then made
to use horizontal motion to bring the cursor to the right column.
If another request is made while one is still in progress,
then the first one is aborted and the second one is initiated.

A safer but less powerful cursor routing command,
<ref id="command-CSRJMP_VERT" name="CSRJMP_VERT">,
uses just vertical motion to bring the cursor
to anywhere on the top line of the braille window.
It's especially useful in conjunction with applications (like <tt/lynx/)
wherein horizontal cursor motion must never be attempted.

<sect1>Cut and Paste<label id="cut"><p>
This feature enables you to grab some text which is already on the screen 
and re-enter it at the current cursor position.
Using it saves time and avoids errors
when a long and/or complicated piece of text needs to be copied,
and even when the same short and simple piece of text needs to be copied many times.
It's particularly useful for things like
long file names,
complicated command lines,
E-mail addresses,
and URLs. Cutting and pasting text involves three simple steps:
<enum>
  <item>
    Mark either the top-left corner of the rectangular area
    or the beginning of the linear area
    on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
    If your display has routing keys,
    then move the braille window so that
    the first character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then:
    <itemize>
      <item>
        invoke the <ref id="command-CUTBEGIN" name="CUTBEGIN"> command
        to start a new cut buffer
      <item>
        invoke the <ref id="command-CUTAPPEND" name="CUTAPPEND"> command
        to append to the existing cut buffer
    </itemize>
    by pressing the key(s) associated with it
    and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.
  <item>
    Mark either the bottom-right corner of the rectangular area
    or the end of the linear area
    on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
    If your display has routing keys,
    then move the braille window so that
    the last character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then
    <itemize>
      <item>
        invoke the <ref id="command-CUTRECT" name="CUTRECT"> command
        to cut a rectangular area
      <item>
        invoke the <ref id="command-CUTLINE" name="CUTLINE"> command
        to cut a linear area
    </itemize>
    by pressing the key(s) associated with it
    and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.
    Marking the end of the cut area
    appends the selected screen content to the cut buffer.
    Excess white-space is removed from the end of each line in the cut buffer
    so that unwanted trailing spaces won't be pasted back in.
    Control characters are replaced with blanks.
  <item>
    Insert (paste) the text where it's needed.
    Place the cursor over the character where the text is to be pasted,
    and invoke the <ref id="command-PASTE" name="PASTE"> command.
    You can paste the same text any number of times without recutting it.
    This description assumes that you're already in some sort of input mode.
    If you paste when you're in some other kind of mode
    (like <tt/vi/'s command mode),
    then you'd better be aware of what the characters in the cut buffer will do.
</enum>

The cut buffer is also used by
the <ref id="command-PRSEARCH" name="PRSEARCH">
and <ref id="command-NXSEARCH" name="NXSEARCH"> commands.

<sect1>Pointer (Mouse) Support via GPM<label id="gpm"><p>
If BRLTTY is configured with the <ref id="build-gpm" name="--enable-gpm"> build option
on a system where the <tt/gpm/ application has been installed,
then it'll interact with the pointer (mouse).

Moving the braille window moves the pointer
(see the <ref id="preference-pointer-follows-window" name="Pointer Follows Window"> preference).
Any motion of the braille window (manual, cursor tracking, etc.),
other than when it moves in response to pointer motion,
moves the pointer to the character on the screen
which corresponds to the upper-left corner of the braille window.
This enables a sighted observer to see where the braille window is,
and, therefore, to know what the braille user is reading.
It also keeps the pointer within the braille window
so that it can be found easily,
and so that the pointer device can always be readily used
as another way to move the braille window.

Moving the pointer drags the braille window
(see the <ref id="preference-window-follows-pointer" name="Window Follows Pointer"> preference).
Whenever the pointer is moved beyond the edge of the braille window,
the braille window is dragged along (one character at a time).
This gives the braille user another two-dimensional way
to inspect the screen content
or to quickly move the braille window to a desired location.
It also gives a sighted observer an easy way to move the braille window
to something he'd like the braille user to read.

<tt/gpm/ uses reverse video to show where the pointer is.
Underlining of highlighted characters
(see the <ref id="command-ATTRVIS" name="ATTRVIS"> command for details)
should be turned on, therefore, when the braille user wishes to use the pointer.

This feature also gives the braille user access to <tt/gpm/'s cut-and-paste capability.
Although you should read <tt/gpm/'s own documentation,
here are some notes on how it works.
<itemize>
  <item>
    Copy the current character to the cut buffer
    by single-clicking the left button.
  <item>
    Copy the current word (space-delimited) to the cut buffer
    by double-clicking the left button.
  <item>
    Copy the current line to the cut buffer
    by tripple-clicking the left button.
  <item>
    Copy a linear region to the cut buffer as follows:
    <enum>
      <item>
        Place the pointer on the first character of the region.
      <item>
        Press (and hold) the left button.
      <item>
        Move the pointer to the last character of the region
        (all currently selected characters are highlighted).
      <item>
        Release the left button.
    </enum>
  <item>
    Paste (input) the current contents of the cut buffer
    by clicking the middle button of a three-button mouse
    or by clicking the right button of a two-button mouse.
  <item>
    Append to the cut buffer
    by using the right button of a three-button mouse.
</itemize>

<sect1>Alert Tunes<label id="tunes"><p>
BRLTTY alerts you to the occurrence of significant events
by playing short predefined tunes.
This feature can be activated and deactivated with
either the <ref id="command-TUNES" name="TUNES"> command
or the <ref id="preference-alert-tunes" name="Alert Tunes"> preference.
The tunes are played via the internal beeper by default,
but other alternatives can be selected
with the <ref id="preference-tune-device" name="Tune Device"> preference.

Each significant event is associated, from highest to lowest priority,
with one or more of the following:
<descrip>
  <tag/a tune/
    If a tune has been associated with the event,
    if the <ref id="preference-alert-tunes" name="Alert Tunes"> preference
    (see also the <ref id="command-TUNES" name="TUNES"> command)
    is active,
    and if the selected tune device
    (see the <ref id="preference-tune-device" name="Tune Device"> preference)
    can be opened,
    then the tune is played.
  <tag/a dot pattern/
    If a dot pattern has been associated with the event,
    and if the <ref id="preference-alert-dots" name="Alert Dots"> preference is active,
    then the dot pattern is briefly displayed on every braille cell.
    Some braille displays don't respond quickly enough
    for this mechanism to work effectively.
  <tag/a message/
    If a message has been associated with the event,
    and if the <ref id="preference-alert-messages" name="Alert Messages"> preference is active,
    then it is displayed for a few seconds
    (see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option).
</descrip>

These events include:
<itemize>
   <item>
     When the braille display driver starts or stops.
   <item>
     When the start or end of the cut block is set.
   <item>
     When a feature is activated or deactivated.
   <item>
     When cursor tracking is turned on or off.
   <item>
     When the screen image is frozen or unfrozen.
   <item>
     When identical lines are skipped.
   <item>
     When the braille window wraps
     either down to the beginning of the next line
     or up to the end of the previous line.
   <item>
     When a requested motion cannot be performed.
   <item>
     When a command cannot be executed.
   <item>
     When a lengthy command completes.
</itemize>

<sect1>Preferences Settings<label id="preferences"><p>
When BRLTTY starts, it loads a file which contains your preferences settings.
The file doesn't need to exist,
and is created the first time the settings are saved
with the <ref id="command-PREFSAVE" name="PREFSAVE"> command.
The most recently saved settings can be restored at any time
with the <ref id="command-PREFLOAD" name="PREFLOAD"> command.

The default name for this file is <tt>/etc/brltty.conf</tt>.
A system default for its name can be established with
the <ref id="configure-preferences-file" name="preferences-file"> configuration file directive.
Its name can be explicitly set at run-time with
the <ref id="options-preferences-file" name="-p"> command line option.

<sect2>The Preferences Menu<label id="preferences-menu"><p>
The preferences settings are saved as binary data
which, therefore, can't be edited by hand.
BRLTTY, however, has a simple menu from which you can easily change them.
This feature isn't available if the
<ref id="build-preferences-menu" name="--disable-preferences-menu"> build option was specified.

The meny is activated by the <ref id="command-PREFMENU" name="PREFMENU"> command.
The braille display briefly
(see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option)
shows the menu title,
and then presents the current item and its current setting.

<Sect3>Navigating the Menu<p>
See <ref id="menu" name="Menu Navigation Commands"> for the full list of
commands which enable you to select items and change settings within the menu.
For backward compatibility with old drivers, the window motion commands,
which have modified meanings in this context, can also be used.
<descrip>
  <tag><tt/TOP/, <tt/TOP_LEFT/</tag>
    Go to the first item in the menu
    (same as <ref id="command-MENU_FIRST_ITEM" name="MENU_FIRST_ITEM">).

Notes:
<itemize>
  <item>
    The routing keys can also be used to select a setting for the current item.
    If the item has numeric settings,
    then each routing key represents an integer (starting from 0),
    and a selection which is out of range is silently brought into range.
    If the item has named settings,
    then the routing keys correspond ordinally with the settings.
  <item>
    Use the <tt/PREFLOAD/ command to undo all of the changes
    which were made since entering the menu.
  <item>
    Use the <tt/PREFMENU/ command (again) to leave the new settings in effect,
    exit the menu, and resume normal operation.
    If the <sq/Save Settings on Exit/ item is set, then, in addition,
    the new settings are written to the preferences settings file.
    Any command not recognized by the menu system also does these same things.

<sect1>The Status Display<label id="status"><p>
The status display is a summary of BRLTTY's current state
which fits completely within the braille window.
Some braille displays have a set of status cells
which are used to permanently display some of this information as well
(see the documentation for your display's driver).
The data presented by this display isn't static, and may change at any time
in response to screen updates and/or BRLTTY commands.

Use the <ref id="command-INFO" name="INFO"> command
to switch to the status display,
and use it again to return to the screen.
The layout of the information contained therein
is dependent on the size of the braille window.

<sect2>Displays with 21 Cells or More<p>

<sect1>Command Learn Mode<label id="learn"><p>
Command learn mode is an interactive way to learn
what the keys on the braille display do.
It can be accessed
either by the <ref id="command-LEARN" name="LEARN"> command
or via the <ref id="utility-brltest" name="brltest"> utility.
This feature isn't available if the
<ref id="build-learn-mode" name="--disable-learn-mode"> build option was specified.

When this mode is entered,
the message <tt/command learn mode/ is written to the braille display.
Then, as each key (or key combination) on the display is pressed,
a short message describing its BRLTTY function is written.
This mode exits immediately if the key (or key combination)
for the <ref id="command-LEARN" name="LEARN"> command is pressed.
It exits automatically, and the message <tt/done/ is written,
if ten seconds elapse without any key on the display being pressed.
Note that some displays don't signal the driver
and/or some drivers don't signal BRLTTY
until all the keys are released.

If a message is longer than the braille display is wide,
then it's displayed in segments.
The length of each segment but the last is one less than the display's width,
with the rightmost character on the display being set to a minus sign.
Each such segment remains on the display
either for a few seconds
(see the <ref id="options-message-delay" name="-M"> command line option)
or until any key on the display is pressed.

<sect1>Contracted Braille<label id="contraction"><p>
BRLTTY can display in-line contracted braille.
It does this if:
<itemize>
  <item>
    A contraction table has been selected.
    See the <ref id="options-contraction-table" name="-c"> command line option
    and the <ref id="configure-contraction-table" name="contraction-table"> configuration file directive
    for details.
  <item>
    The 6-dot braille feature has been activated.
    See the <ref id="command-SIXDOTS" name="SIXDOTS"> command
    and the <ref id="preference-text-style" name="Text Style"> preference
    for details.
</itemize>
This feature isn't available if the
<ref id="build-contracted-braille" name="--disable-contracted-braille"> build option was specified.

The following contraction tables are provided:
<descrip>
  <tag/big5.ctb/Chinese big5.
  <tag/big5/Chinese
  <tag/compress/Remove excessive white-space.
  <tag/en-us-g2/Grade 2 American English.
</descrip>

<sect2>File Format<p>
Blank lines are ignored.
Any leading and trailing white-space (any number of blanks and/or tabs) is ignored.
Lines which begin with a number sign (<tt/&num;/) are ignored,
i.e. they're comments.
<tscreen>&num; This is a comment.</tscreen>
All other lines define table entries.

The general form of a table entry is an opcode followed by its operands.
The opcode and its operands are separated from one another by white-space.
Each opcode has a specific number of operands,
and any text following its last operand is treated as a comment.
<tscreen><em/opcode/ <em/operand/ ... <em/comment/</tscreen>

The opcode is a number which tells the translator how to interpret the operands.
Opcode <tt/0/ can be used to assign a meaningful name to each needed opcode,
e.g. <tt/opcode/ for <tt/0/ itself.
If, for example, a table begins with:
<tscreen>0 0 opcode</tscreen>
then all the rest of the opcodes it needs can be defined like this:
<tscreen>opcode 1 include</tscreen>
This scheme, i.e. no built-in opcode names, was chosen in order to allow
a table for some language's braille to be written solely in that language itself.

The following operand types are supported:
<descrip>
  <tag/string/
    A sequence of characters other than
    white-space (which terminates the string)
    and backslashes (<tt/&bsol;/).
    The following special representations are also supported:
    <descrip>
      <tag><tt/&bsol;&bsol;/</tag>backslash
      <tag><tt/&bsol;f/</tag>form feed
      <tag><tt/&bsol;n/</tag>new line
      <tag><tt/&bsol;o/<em/ooo/</tag>3-digit octal value
      <tag><tt/&bsol;r/</tag>carriage return
      <tag><tt/&bsol;s/</tag>blank (space)
      <tag><tt/&bsol;t/</tag>horizontal tab
      <tag><tt/&bsol;v/</tag>vertical tab
      <tag><tt/&bsol;x/<em/xx/</tag>2-digit hexadecimal value
    </descrip>
  <tag/number/
    An integer.
    It may be specified in any of the following ways:
    <descrip>
      <tag/decimal/
        A sequence of decimal digits (<tt/0/-<tt/9/),
        with the first digit being nonzero (<tt/1/-<tt/9/).
      <tag/hexadecimal/
        A sequence of hexadecimal digits (<tt/0/-<tt/9/, and either <tt/a/-<tt/f/ or <tt/A/-<tt/F/),
        preceded by either <tt/0x/ or <tt/0X/.
      <tag/octal/
        A sequence of octal digits (<tt/0/-<tt/7/),
        with the first digit being zero (<tt/0/).
    </descrip>
  <tag/dots/
    A braille symbol.
    The braille dots must be specified via their standard numbers
    (see section <ref id="dots" name="Braille Dot Numbering Convention">),
    and, for a multi-cell symbol, the cell specifications
    must be separated from one another by a dash (<tt/-/).
    For example, the contraction for the English word <tt/lord/
    (the letter <tt/l/ prefixed with dot 5)
    would be specified as <tt/5-123/.
    A space may be specified via the special dot number <tt/0/.

<sect2>Opcodes by Function<label id="contraction-opcode-function"><p>
Now for all of the details.
The opcodes here are grouped by function rather than sorted by number.
For a numerically sorted list, see section
<ref id="contraction-opcode-number" name="Opcode Summary by Number">.

<sect3>Table Administration<p>
These opcodes make it easier to write contraction tables.
They have no direct effect on the character translation.
<descrip>
  <tag>0 <em/opcode/ <em/name/<label id="contraction-opcode-0"></tag>
    Assign a name to an opcode.
    The name must be defined before it's used.
  <tag>1 <em/path/<label id="contraction-opcode-1"></tag>
    Include the contents of another file.
    Nesting can be to any depth.
    Relative paths are anchored at the directory of the including file.
  <tag>26 <em/locale/<label id="contraction-opcode-26"></tag>
    Define the locale for character interpretation
    (lowercase, uppercase, numeric, etc.).
    The locale may be specified as:
    <descrip>
      <tag><em/language/[<tt/_/<em/country/][<tt/./<em/charset/][<tt/@/<em/modifier/]</tag>
        The <em/language/ component is required and should be a two-letter <tt/ISO-639/ language code.
        The <em/country/ component is optional and should be a two-letter <tt/ISO-3166/ country code.
        The <em/charset/ component is optional and should be a character set name, e.g. <tt/ISO-8859-1/.
      <tag/C/
        7-bit ASCII.
      <tag/-/
        No locale.
    </descrip>
    The last locale specification applies to the entire table.
    If this opcode isn't used then the <tt/C/ locale is assumed.
</descrip>

<sect3>Special Symbol Definition<p>
These opcodes define special symbols which must be
inserted into the braille text in order to clarify it.
<descrip>
  <tag>2 <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-2"></tag>
    The symbol which capitalizes a single letter.
  <tag>3 <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-3"></tag>
    The symbol which begins a block of capital letters within a word.
  <tag>25 <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-25"></tag>
    The symbol which ends a block of capital letters within a word.
  <tag>4 <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-4"></tag>
    The symbol which marks a letter which isn't part of a word.
  <tag>5 <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-5"></tag>
    The symbol which marks the beginning of a number.
</descrip>

<sect3>Character Translation<p>
These opcodes define the braille representations for character sequences.
Each of them defines an entry within the contraction table.
These entries may be defined in any order except, as noted below,
when they define alternate representations for the same character sequence.

Each of these opcodes has
a <em/characters/ operand (which must be specified as a <em/string/),
and a built-in condition governing its eligibility for use.
The text is processed strictly from left to right, character by character,
with the most eligible entry for each position being used.
If there's more than one eligible entry for a given position,
then the one with the longest character string is used.
If there's more than one eligible entry for the same character string,
then the one defined nearest to the beginning of the table is used
(this is the only order dependency).

Many of these opcodes have a <em/dots/ operand
which defines the braille representation for its <em/characters/ operand.
It may also be specified as an equals sign (<tt/=/),
in which case it means one of two things.
If the entry is for a single character,
then it means that the currently selected computer braille representation
(see the <ref id="options-text-table" name="-t"> command line option
and the <ref id="configure-text-table" name="text-table"> configuration file directive)
for that character is to be used.
If it's for a multi-character sequence,
then the default representation for each character
(see <ref id="contraction-opcode-6" name="opcode 6">)
within the sequence is to be used.

Some special terms are used within the descriptions of these opcodes.
<descrip>
  <tag/word/
    A maximal sequence of one or more consecutive letters.
</descrip>

Now, finally, here are the opcode descriptions themselves:
<descrip>
  <tag>17 <em/characters/<label id="contraction-opcode-17"></tag>
    Translate the entire white-space-bounded containing character sequence into computer braille
    (see the <ref id="options-text-table" name="-t"> command line option
    and the <ref id="configure-text-table" name="text-table"> configuration file directive).
  <tag>19 <em/characters/ <em/characters/<label id="contraction-opcode-19"></tag>
    Replace the first set of characters, no matter where they appear, with the second.
    The replaced characters aren't reprocessed.
  <tag>6 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-6"></tag>
    Translate the characters no matter where they appear.
    If there's only one character, then, in addition,
    define the default representation for that character.
  <tag>7 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-7"></tag>
    Translate the characters no matter where they appear.
    Ignore any consecutive repetitions of the same sequence.
  <tag>15 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-15"></tag>
    Translate the characters no matter where they appear.
    Remove white-space between consecutive words matched by this opcode.
  <tag>8 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-8"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're a word.
  <tag>16 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-16"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're a word.
    Remove the following white-space if the first character after it is a letter.
  <tag>14 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-14"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're a white-space-bounded word.
  <tag>18 <em/characters/<label id="contraction-opcode-18"></tag>
    Prefix the characters with a letter sign
    (see <ref id="contraction-opcode-4" name="opcode 4">)
    if they're a word.
  <tag>24 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-24"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're either a word or at the beginning of a word.
  <tag>9 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-9"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're at the beginning of a word.
  <tag>10 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-10"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're in the middle of a word.
  <tag>12 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-12"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're either in the middle or at the end of a word.
  <tag>11 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-11"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're at the end of a word.
  <tag>22 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-22"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're part of punctuation at the beginning of a word.
  <tag>23 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-23"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're part of punctuation at the end of a word.
  <tag>21 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-21"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're at the beginning of a number.
  <tag>13 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-13"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're in the middle of a number.
  <tag>20 <em/characters/ <em/dots/<label id="contraction-opcode-20"></tag>
    Translate the characters if they're at the end of a number.
</descrip>

<sect>Translation Tables<label id="translation"><p>
BRLTTY uses two <bf/translation tables/ to govern
the mapping from bytes to dot combinations.

<sect1>Text Translation<label id="translation-text"><p>
The first, and most important, is the text translation table.
BRLTTY is initially configured to use the
<ref id="nabcc" name="North American Braille Computer Code"> (NABCC).
In addition to this default text translation table,
several alternatives are provided:
<descrip>
  <tag/cz/Czech (iso-8859-2)
  <tag/da/Danish
  <tag/de/German
  <tag/es/Spanish
  <tag/fr/French
  <tag/fr-cbifs/French (Code Braille Informatique Français Standard)
  <tag/it/Italian
  <tag/nabcc/North American Braille Computer Code
  <tag/no-h/Norwegian and German
  <tag/no-p/Norwegian
  <tag/pl/Polish (iso-8859-2)
  <tag/ru/Russian (koi8-r)
  <tag/se1/Swedish
  <tag/se2/Swedish
  <tag/uk/United Kingdom English
  <tag/us/American English
  <tag/vni/Vietnamese
</descrip>
See the <ref id="options-text-table" name="-t"> command line option,
the <ref id="configure-text-table" name="text-table"> configuration file directive,
and the <ref id="build-text-table" name="--with-text-table"> build option
for details regarding how to use an alternate text translation table.

<sect1>Attributes Translation<label id="translation-attributes"><p>
The attributes translation table is used when BRLTTY
is displaying screen attributes rather than screen content
(see the <ref id="command-DISPMD" name="DISPMD"> command).
Each of the eight braille dots represents one of the eight attribute bits.
The following attributes translation tables are provided:
<descrip>
  <tag/attributes/
    The lefthand column represents the background colours:
    <descrip>
      <tag/Dot 1/Red
      <tag/Dot 2/Green
      <tag/Dot 3/Blue
      <tag/Dot 7/Blink
    </descrip>
    The righthand column represents the foreground colours:
    <descrip>
      <tag/Dot 4/Red
      <tag/Dot 5/Green
      <tag/Dot 6/Blue
      <tag/Dot 8/Bright
    </descrip>
    A dot is raised when its corresponding attribute bit is on.
    This is the default attributes translation table
    because it's the most intuitive.
    One of its problems, though, is that it's difficult to discern
    the difference between normal (white on black)
    and reverse (black on white) video.
  <tag/attrib/
    The lefthand column represents the background colours:
    <descrip>
      <tag/Dot 1/Red
      <tag/Dot 2/Green
      <tag/Dot 3/Blue
      <tag/Dot 7/Blink
    </descrip>
    The righthand column represents the foreground colours:
    <descrip>
      <tag/Dot 4/Red
      <tag/Dot 5/Green
      <tag/Dot 6/Blue
      <tag/Dot 8/Bright
    </descrip>
    A foreground bit being on triggers its corresponding dot,
    whereas a background bit being off triggers its corresponding dot.
    This unintuitive logic actually makes it easier
    to read the most commonly used attribute combinations.
</descrip>
See the <ref id="options-attributes-table" name="-a"> command line option,
the <ref id="configure-attributes-table" name="attributes-table"> configuration file directive,
and the <ref id="build-attributes-table" name="--with-attributes-table"> build option
for details regarding how to use an alternate attributes translation table.

<sect1>Table Format<p>
A translation table is a 256-byte binary file.
It's indexed with either a character or an attributes byte,
and the byte at that position contains the corresponding dot combination.
The mapping from bit to dot is as follows:
<descrip>
  <tag/Bit 0/Dot 1
  <tag/Bit 1/Dot 4
  <tag/Bit 2/Dot 2
  <tag/Bit 3/Dot 5
  <tag/Bit 4/Dot 3
  <tag/Bit 5/Dot 6
  <tag/Bit 6/Dot 7
  <tag/Bit 7/Dot 8
</descrip>
This particular mapping makes it easy and efficient for BRLTTY
to vertically shift a dot pattern.

<sect1>Table Utilities<p>
These utilities reside within the <tt/BrailleTables/ subdirectory,
and aren't built as part of the regular procedure.
To build them,
first ensure that BRLTTY has been configured
(see section <ref id="build" name="Build Options">),
and then run <tt/make/ within the <tt/BrailleTables/ subdirectory.
<tscreen><verb>
cd BrailleTables
make
</verb></tscreen>

<sect2>tbl2txt<label id="utility-tbl2txt"><p>
This utility converts (uncompiles) a translation table into a text file
for readability and/or modification.
<tscreen>tbl2txt -<em/option/ ... <em/table-file/ <em/text-file/</tscreen>
<descrip>
  <tag><em/table-file/</tag>
    The translation table which is to be converted.
  <tag><em/text-file/</tag>
    The file into which the text representing the table content is to be written.
  <tag><tt/-c/<em/name/ <tt/--code-page=/<em/name/</tag>
    The character set used to annotate each line of the text file.
</descrip>

The generated text file can, without modification, be recompiled back into a
translation table with the <ref id="utility-txt2tbl" name="txt2tbl"> utility.
Each of its lines contains lots of interesting information.

If the <tt/-c/ option isn't specified, each line looks like this:
<tscreen><em/cc/ <em/xx/ <em/ddd/ (73214568)<em/tt/ B+<em/bbbb/ <em/name/</tscreen>
If the <tt/-c/ option is specified, each line looks like this:
<tscreen><em/cc/ <em/xx/ <em/ddd/ (73214568)<em/tt/ B+<em/bbbb/ U+<em/uuuu/ <em/description/</tscreen>
<descrip>
  <tag><em/cc/</tag>
    The character itself.
    Unprintable characters are represented canonically.
    Control characters are flagged with a circumflex,
    e.g. Control-A (character 1) is <tt/&circ;A/. 
    Meta control characters are flagged with a tilde,
    e.g. Meta-Control-A (character 129) is <tt/&tilde;A/. 
  <tag><em/xx/</tag>
    The hexadecimal value of the character.
  <tag><em/ddd/</tag>
    The decimal value of the character.
  <tag><tt/(73214568)/</tag>
    The braille dot numbers.
    If a dot isn't to be raised,
    then its number is replaced with a blank.
    The English letter <tt/y/, for example, would be
    <tt/(&nbsp;3&nbsp;1456&nbsp;)/.
    The dot numbers appear in the same order
    as on a standard braille keyboard
    so as to make it easier to visualize the braille character.
  <tag><em/tt/</tag>
    The hexadecimal value of the byte representing the dot combination
    which is in the translation table.
  <tag><em/bbbb/</tag>
    The hexadecimal value of the unicode number
    corresponding to the dot combination.
  <tag><em/name/</tag>
    The ASCII name of the character
    (only shown if the <tt/-c/ option isn't specified).
  <tag><em/uuuu/</tag>
    The hexadecimal value of the unicode number
    corresponding to the character
    (only shown if the <tt/-c/ option is specified).
  <tag><em/description/</tag>
    The formal unicode description for the character
    (only shown if the <tt/-c/ option is specified).
</descrip>

<sect2>txt2tbl<label id="utility-txt2tbl"><p>
This utility compiles a translation table.
<tscreen>txt2tbl -<em/option/ ... <em/text-file/ <em/table-file/</tscreen>
<descrip>
  <tag><em/text-file/</tag>
    The source file describing the table content.
  <tag><em/table-file/</tag>
    The file into which the translation table is to be written.
  <tag><tt/-d/ <tt/--duplicates/</tag>
    Display a warning for each dot combination which has been used more than once.
  <tag><tt/-m/ <tt/--missing/</tag>
    Display a warning for each dot combination which hasn't been used.
</descrip>

A line which assigns a dot combination to a character
must contain that dot combination within parenthesis, e.g. <tt/(12)/.
The text file must contain exactly 256 such lines, each one, in order,
defining the braille representation for its corresponding character.
The dot numbers may be specified in any order,
but each must only be specified once.
It's valid to specify no number at all, e.g. <tt/()/ (for a space).
Any number of spaces may occur any number of times anywhere between the parentheses.
All characters before the left parenthesis and after the right parenthesis are ignored.
All lines which don't contain a left parenthesis are ignored.

The algorithm for locating the dot numbers is actually a bit more complicated
because a line may contain more than one left and/or right parenthesis
(the <ref id="utility-tbl2txt" name="tbl2txt"> utility does this).
The first right parenthesis which is preceded by at least one left parenthesis is used.
The nearest left parenthesis to the left of that right parenthesis is used.
The line <tt/)((12)/, for example, is valid.

<sect2>tbl2tbl<label id="utility-tbl2tbl"><p>
This utility converts a binary translation table from one dot mapping to another.
<tscreen>tbl2tbl <em/input-mapping/ <em/output-mapping/</tscreen>
<descrip>
  <tag><em/input-mapping/</tag>
    The dot mapping used within the source table.
  <tag><em/output-mapping/</tag>
    The dot mapping to be used within the table being generated.
</descrip>
The source table is read from standard input,
and the converted table is written to standard output.
The following dot mappings are supported:
<descrip>
  <tag/standard/
    BRLTTY's native mapping (described above).
  <tag/tieman/
    The mapping used by <htmlurl url="http://www.braillevoyager.nl/uk/index.html" name="Tieman B.V.">.

<sect>The Application Programming Interface<label id="api"><p>
This section hasn't been written yet.

<sect>Advanced Topics<p>

<sect1>Installing Multiple Versions<label id="multiple"><p>
It's easy to have more than one version of BRLTTY
installed on the same system at the same time.
This capability allows you to test a new version before removing the old one.

The <ref id="build-execute-root" name="--with-execute-root"> build option allows you
to install the complete <ref id="hierarchy" name="installed file hierarchy">
anywhere you want such that it's entirely self-contained.
Remembering that it's best to keep all of BRLTTY's components
within the root file system, you can build it like this:
<tscreen><verb>
./configure --with-execute-root=/brltty-3.1
make install
</verb></tscreen>
You can then run it like this:
<tscreen>/brltty-3.1/bin/brltty</tscreen>
When version 3.2 is released, just install it in a different location
and run the new executable from there.
<tscreen><verb>
./configure --with-execute-root=/brltty-3.2
make install
/brltty-3.2/bin/brltty
</verb></tscreen>

So far, this paradigm is somewhat awkward for at least two reasons.
One is that these long path names are too hard to type,
and the other is that you don't want to fiddle with your system's boot sequence
each time you want to switch to a different version of BRLTTY.
These problems are easily solved by adding a symbolic link for the executable.
<tscreen>ln -s /brltty-3.1/bin/brltty /bin/brltty</tscreen>
When it's time to switch to the newer version, just repoint the symbolc link.
<tscreen>ln -s /brltty-3.2/bin/brltty /bin/brltty</tscreen>

If you'd like to get really fancy, then introduce another level of indirection
in order to make all of BRLTTY's files for any given version
look like they're in all of the standard places.
First, create a symbolic link through a common repointable location
from each of BRLTTY's standard locations.
<tscreen><verb>
ln -s /brltty/bin/brltty /bin/brltty
ln -s /brltty/etc/brltty /etc/brltty
ln -s /brltty/lib/brltty /lib/brltty
</verb></tscreen>
Then all you need to do is to point <tt>/brltty</> to the desired version.
<tscreen>ln -s /brltty-3.1 /brltty</tscreen>

<sect1>Installation/Rescue Root Disks for Linux<p>
BRLTTY can run as a stand-alone executable.
Everything it needs to know can be explicitly configured at build-time
(see <ref id="build" name="Build Options">).
If the data directory
(see the <ref id="build-data-directory" name="--sysconfdir">
and <ref id="build-execute-root" name="--with-execute-root"> build options)
doesn't exist, then BRLTTY looks in <tt>/etc</> for the files it needs.
Even if any of these files don't exist at all, BRLTTY still works!

If, for some reason, you ever create the data directory
(usually <tt>/etc/brltty</>) by hand, it's important
to set its permissions so that only root can create files within it.
<tscreen>chmod 755 /etc/brltty</tscreen>

The screen content inspection device (usually <tt>/dev/vcsa</>) is required.
It should already exist unless your Linux distribution is quite old.
If necessary, you can create it with:
<tscreen><verb>
mknod /dev/vcsa c 7 128
chmod 660 /dev/vcsa
chown root.tty /dev/vcsa
</verb></tscreen>

One problem often encountered when trying to use BRLTTY
in an uncertain environment like a root disk or an incomplete system is
that it might not find the shared libraries (or parts thereof) which it needs.
Root disks often use subset and/or outdated versions of the libraries
which may be inadequate.
The solution is to configure BRLTTY with the
<ref id="build-standalone-programs" name="--enable-standalone-programs"> build option.
This removes all dependencies on shared libraries,
but, unfortunately, also creates a larger executable.
There are a number of build options which can be used
to selectively remove unneeded features from BRLTTY
in order to somewhat mitigate this problem
(see section <ref id="build-features" name="Build Features">).

The executable is stripped during the <ref id="make-install" name="make install">.
This significantly reduces its size by removing its symbol table.
You'll get a much smaller executable, therefore,
if you complete the full build procedure,
and then copy it from its installed location.
If, however, you copy it from the build directory, it'll be way too big.
Don't forget to strip it.
<tscreen>strip brltty</tscreen>

<sect1>Future Enhancements<p>
Apart from fixing bugs and supporting more types of braille displays,
we hope, time permitting, to work on the following:
<descrip>
  <tag/Better Attribute Handling/
    <itemize>
      <item>Attribute tracking.
      <item>Mixed text and attribute mode.
    </itemize>
  <tag/Scroll Tracking/
    Locking the braille window to one line as it scrolls on the screen.
  <tag/Better Speech Support/
    <itemize>
      <item>Mixed braille and speech for faster reading of text.
      <item>Better speech navigation.
      <item>More speech synthesizers.
    </itemize>
  <tag/Screen Subregions/
    Ignore cursor motion outside the region,
    and set soft navigational boundaries at the edges of the region.
</descrip>
See the file <tt/TODO/ for a more complete list.

<sect1>Known Bugs<p>
At the time of writing (December 2001), the following problems are known:

Cursor routing is implemented as a looping sub-process
which runs at reduced priority to avoid using too much cpu time.
Different system loads require different settings of its parameters.
The defaults work very well
in a typical Unix editor on a fairly lightly loaded system,
but very poorly in some other situations,
e.g. over a slow serial link to a remote host.

<sect1>Braille Dot Numbering Convention<label id="dots"><p>
A standard braille cell consists of six dots
arranged in two columns and three rows.
Computer braille has introduced a fourth row at the bottom.
Each dot can be specifically identified by its number as follows:
<descrip>
  <tag/1/Row 1 (top) left.
  <tag/2/Row 2 left.
  <tag/3/Row 3 left.
  <tag/4/Row 1 (top) right.
  <tag/5/Row 2 right.
  <tag/6/Row 3 right.
  <tag/7/Row 4 (bottom) left.
  <tag/8/Row 4 (bottom) right.
</descrip>
Perhaps a picture will make this numbering convention easier to understand.
<tscreen><verb>
1 o o 4
