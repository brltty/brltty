# BRLTTY Text Table - Russian
# by Hans Schou <chlor@schou.dk> and Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>

# This is the Russian braille table. It is based on the KOI8-R character set
# which to our knowledge is the most used in Russia.

# As the Russian cyrillic definition conflicts with the latin definition, some
# decisions had to be taken. Russians need to type both latin for the command
# prompt and cyrillic while reading and writing documents and mail.

# In the following, latin letters are quoted with apostrophes like in 'a', and
# cyrillic letters are enclosed within brackets like in [a].

# Dot 1 in the cyrillic definition is the cyrillic letter which looks and
# sounds like 'a'. The problem is that in the KOI8-R character set, there is
# both a latin 'a' and a cyrillic [a]. In decimal, their character numbers are
# 97 and 193 respectively.  To handle conflicts like these, we have prioritized
# which characters are most important to match the standard.

# RULES:
# 1. All cyrillic characters must follow the Russian standard. KOI8-R character 
#    193 [a] must be dot-1, and so on.
# 2. Capital cyrillic letters have dot 7 on.
# 3. The latin alphabet is implemented to follow the international standard
#    except it has dot 8 on.
# 4. Capital latin letters have dots 7 and 8 on.
# 5. Numbers are defined as in the American standard. This means dot-2 for
#    number '1', and so on. This will conflict with the cyrillic comma which is
#    also dot-2.
# 4. Special characters like !"#¤%&/()=? follow the American standard if 
#    possible.
# 2. Control characters are often used on Linux. These are not very well 
#    implemented. More work should be done.

# Comments from Russians are very welcome as neither Hans Schou nor Dave Mielke
# understand a single word in Russian.
