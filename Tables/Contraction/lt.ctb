# The Lithuanian 6-dot Braille alphabet is described in a decree
# no. 878 of the Minister of Education, called "Dėl perėjimo prie
# naujos lietuviškos Brailio rašto abėcėlės tvarkos ir programos",
# which is in effect since 2000-07-08. Document number is 55-1620. At
# the time of writing this file, the document was accessible at
# https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.A110E8E6A83F .
# The document is referred to as "the standard" below.
#
# The standard specifies only the mapping of Lithuanian letters to 6-dot
# Braille writing system, no other characters are defined in it.
# Definitions of some punctuation and other characters are informally
# available on the Internet.
#
# This table builds on from these bits of information, but also adds
# a number of other definitions to make it more useful in computing.
#
# This table is based on the respective liblouis table.
