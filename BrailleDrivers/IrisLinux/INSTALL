INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR IRISLINUX:
	Before using the driver, you will need little installation.
	The IrisLinux driver software uses a kernel-level driver to communicate
	with a chicp into the Iris PDA. There is a "iris_gio" subdirectory,
	which contains the driver's source to be compiled into the kernel.
	To compile it, do the following:
1) Install a kernel sourcetree into a directory:
	If you plan to use a little capacity CompactFlash card, you can compile
	it from a PC (the target processor is Pentium-Classic).
	- IDE Driver: Cyrix Corp. 8530 Dri2er.
	- USB: OHCI-HCD Driver (no USB 2.0).
	- LAN: DaviCom dmfe module, present into the "Tulip" series;
	- MODEM: no drived needed, accessible with a Serial port (/dev/ttyS2).
	- Serial: 16550A UART, generic.
	- CompactFlash: seen as IDE devices, no driver needed.
	- AUDIO: OSS -> 100% Compatible Sound Blaster 16: io=220, irq=5, 
	  dma=1, dma16=5
	- Power Management: None.

	After configuring and making your kernel, it's time to compile
	our iris_gio specific stuff.

2) Compiling
	To compile it, jo into your IrisLinux/iris_gio subdirectory :
	$ cd brltty/BrailleDrivers/IrisLinux/iris_gio/ 

	And start the make program replacing kernel-source with 
	the path where you uncompressed your kernel in stage 1.
	$ make -C /path/to/kernel/source SUBDIRS=$PWD
	
	This will compile the driver and create a "iris_gio.ko" file.

3) Install
	Then, after doing a "make modules_install" into the kernel sourcetree,
	do a :

	# make -C /path/to/kernel/source SUBDIRS=$PWD modules_install

	And you're done!

4) Post-Install
	Before starting brltty, you'll need to do two things:
	1) Create the iris-gio character device:
	# mknod /dev/iris c 254 0
	(Needed only once).

	2) Each time you boot, or reboot, you'll need to do a :
	# modprobe iris-gio

	You can consider adding "iris-gio" into the /etc/modules file but take
	care that the module must be inserted into the kernel before brltty 
	is started.


Do Not hesitate to contact me if you have any question about this procedure.
And keep in mind this a specific stuff, so do not attempt for now any script
that would to the things for you: I don't have enough time to create them.
