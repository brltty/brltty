The front keys, when in input mode, are interpreted differently. The eight Bn
keys are interpreted as the eight braille dots; pressing any combination of
them inputs the corresponding character. The UP and DN bars are interpreted as
space bars; pressing either of them inputs a space. Key combinations involving
both the Bn keys and the UP/DN bars, as well as those involving the routing
and/or status keys, still function as described above. The Bn (front key)  to
Dn (braille dot) mapping has been designed to represent the conventional
layout, and is as follows: B1=D7 B2=D3 B3=D2 B4=D1 B5=D4 B6=D5 B7=D6 B8=D8
