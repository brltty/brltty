This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the SpeechDispatcher text
to speech server [http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd]. It was implemented, and is
being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if Speech
Dispatcher has been installed. The default is to check the directories /usr,
/usr/local, /usr/local/speech-dispatcher, /usr/local/speechd,
/opt/speech-dispatcher, and /opt/speechd. The actual location can be explicitly
specified via --with-speechd.

If this driver is built as a dynamically loaded shared object (the default),
i.e. it isn't linked into BRLTTY's binary via --with-speech-driver, then the
directory $SPEECHD_HOME/lib must be added to the colon-delimited list of
directories in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before BRLTTY is
started because Speech Dispatcher's own shared objects don't contain run-time
search paths for their internal dependencies.

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

   Parameter Settings
   address   address of speech-dispatcher's server
   autospawn yes,no
   module    name (flite, festival, epos-generic, dtk-generic, ...)
   language  two-letter language code
   voice     type (male1, female1, male2, female2, male3, female3,
                   child_male, child_female)
