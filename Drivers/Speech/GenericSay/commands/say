# Simple BrlTTY GenericSay helper script.
# It should be installed as "/usr/local/bin/say".

# If your speech synthesizer does not require any special initialization
# sequences, and if you either are satisfied with its default settings or
# don't know how to change them, then this helper script is for you. It
# does no more than simply send the text to be spoken directly to your
# synthesizer. Note that, being totally general, it cannot, and does
# not, implement the mute function. All you need to do is:
# - Set the device (see "device=" line below).
# - Install the script (as /usr/local/bin/say).

device=/dev/ttyS0
