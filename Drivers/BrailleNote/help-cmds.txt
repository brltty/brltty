Braille Note Commands

Design Considerations:
Common navigations can be made with the four thumb keys on the front surface. They're named (from left to right): Previous, Back, Advance, Next.
All navigations can be made via combinations of dots 1 through 6 with no modifier keys when in navigation mode.
Characters can be entered via combinations of dots 1 through 6 with no modifier keys when in one of the input modes (which govern the states of dots 7 and 8).
Commands are invoked via combinations of dots 1 through 6 together with the space bar.
Common options can be turned off via combinations of dots 1 through 6 together with the space bar and the backspace key (to the left of dot 3).
Common options can be turned on via combinations of dots 1 through 6 together with the space bar and the enter key (to the right of dot 6).
Some special commands, due to the need for logical key combination sequences, and aggravated because the Braille Note itself intercepts certain key combinations for its own purposes, violate these conventions.

Common Navigations:
To move left or right one window (wrapping to previous or next line), use Previous or Next.

To move to the left or right end of the line, use Previous+Back or Next+Advance.
