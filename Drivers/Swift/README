This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the Swift text to speech
engine from Cepstral [http://www.cepstral.com/]. It was implemented, and is
being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if Swift has been
installed. The default is to check the directories /usr, /usr/local,
/opt/swift, and /opt/Swift. The actual location can be explicitly specified via
--with-swift.

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

   Parameter Settings
   name      name (human), /path/to/directory

If the human name of the voice is specified then it is interpreted as a Swift
voice directory if it begins with a slash and as a subdirectory of
$SWIFT_HOME/voices/ if it doesn't.
