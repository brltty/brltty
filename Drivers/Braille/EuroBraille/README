SUPPORTED HARDWARE
==================
All EuroBraille's displays should be supported here. However it has been tested
on the following hardware:
   - a Clio-Notebraille (20,40,80);
   - a Scriba (20,40);
   - an Azerbraille (40,80);
   - a Clio-PupiBraille (80);
   - an Iris (S20, S32, 40, KB40);
   - an EsyS (12,40,64).
   - The driver is also tested with a NoteBraille display in order to 
     maintain backward compatibility.


FIXES/ADDITIONS
===============
Version 2.0.0:
	- Complete rewrite of the whole driver to support new EsysIris
	  protocol (serial and ethernet connection supported).
	- Support Iris (firmware 1.71 and later)
	- Support ESYS 12/40 display.
	- Ability to autodetect which protocol to use.

Version 1.3.4:
	- Support the suspend/resume BRLTTY feature.

Version 1.3.3:
	- Corrected several bugs in write/read operations;
	- Corrected several key bugs on Iris models.

Version 1.3.2:
	- Remade the brl_ReadPacket and brl_WritePacket, to allow writing of
	  low-level packets and error code retrieving;
	- Full Iris support;

Version 1.3.1:
	- Many code cleanups;
	- Corrected AzerBraille 40 Programming keys bugs;
	- Added a LOG_IO define to log in/out packets to a file;
	- Started to debug the Iris identification failures, still not work
	  perfectly;

Version 1.3 :
	- Made the driver BrlAPI compatible
	- The transfer code has been removed: it will be now in a separate 
	  program, called `tp' (in progress).
	- code cleanups;

Version 1.2 :
	- Significantly reduced the size of the sourcecode: proper and easier
	  to understand/customize;
	- Added LCD support;
	- Beta new Iris 20/32/40 support, not tested yet;
	- Re-added Cut-n-paste routines: it was disabled, don't know why...

Version 1.1a :
	- Minor changes to function-keys to make the program easier to 
	  undepstand. 
	- The on-line help function disappeared, and is replaced by the 
	  CMD_LEARN (learn mode) function directly implemented within BrlTty.


Version 1.1:
	- Fixed bugs due to changes of brltty core functions
	- Changed keys' insertion: We now use sequential mode for meta and
	  control keys, to allow more combinations. Moreover the input table is
	  now attached to the output table. 

Version 1.0 :
   	- added an internal menu to allow console switching or to enter in the
	  help menu. 
     	  Here, a Scriba-like interface was implemented. Read the "README.menu"
     	  file if you didn't use a Scriba (or the Draculawin program) before to
     	  learn more about this menu.
   	- When the drivers starts, it now plays a melody on the terminal's 
	  internal speaker. 
	  This was made to ensure the user that the driver is loaded and is
       	  ready to be used.

Version 0.9: 
   	- You can now view the internal date/time of your display, typing "#M" 
	  (or "Alpha+L9" on a Scriba). This doesn't work very well - don't know 
	  why...

Version 0.8:
   	- Minor changes were made in the use of the "inskey()" function.
   	- Fixed bugs in the ViewOn() and the Program() functions.

Version 0.7: 
   	- Added the "Programming" and the "View on" functions. Their respective 
     	  behaviors are as in the DOS program (ReadBraille). See the 
	  "README.model" file where "Model" is the name of your display. 
	  Actually, files are written for the Clio-Notebraille and the Scriba 
	  displays.

Version 0.6:
   	- Fixed the "enter bug": The "\n" inserted code is now replaced by 
	  "\x0D".

Version 0.5: 
   	- Added the ability for the user to type letters directly from his/her
     	  terminal. The table implemented is the CBIFS (French) table.

Comments are strongly welcomed, because I don't know how many people use the 
EuroBraille version of BRLTTY in the world so if you use this driver, just 
e-mail us what are your suggestions for next versions.
