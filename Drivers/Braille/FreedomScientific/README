This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for the Focus and PAC Mate braille
displays from Freedom Scientific [http://www.freedomscientific.com]. It has
been implemented, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

The most important single command is the one to access the help screen. On the
PAC Mate display this is the key just to the right of the center marker (also
referred to as HK5 below). On the Focus, this is chord H (Space+Dot1+Dot2+
Dot5).

The serial and USB ports are both supported. The following models are 
recognized:
*  Focus: 44, 70, 84
*  Focus 2: 40, 80
*  PAC Mate: 20, 40

If an unrecognized model is connected then the driver makes an attempt to
determine its size and to provide generic capabilities.

The upper row of routing buttons on the PAC Mate are a set of hot keys. They
provide quick access to various braille display functions and options (see the
help screen for what they actually do). There are three markers at the back of
the display's top surface, i.e. just behind the routing buttons, which help you
locate and distinguish each hot key. The keys immediately below the left and
right markers are the left and right GDF keys. Between them are eight keys ...
four on each side of the center marker. The buttons between the left GDF key
and the center marker are named (from left to right) HK1, HK2, HK3, and HK4;
those between the center marker and the right GDF key are named (from left to
right) HK5, HK6, HK7, and HK8. Any button to the left of the left GDF key acts
as the left advance key, and any button to the right of the right GDF key acts
as the right advance key. The following drawing depicts this layout visually:

                ++                     ++                     ++
                ||                     ||                     ||
                ||                     ||                     ||
  ...+---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---++---+...
