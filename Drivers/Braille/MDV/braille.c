/* MDV/braille.c - Braille display driver for MDV displays.
 *
 * Written by Stéphane Doyon (s.doyon@videotron.ca) in collaboration with
 * Simone Dal Maso <sdalmaso@protec.it>.
 *
 * It is being tested on MB408S, should also support MB208 and MB408L.
 * It is designed to be compiled in BRLTTY version 2.91-3.0.
 *
 * History:
 * 0.8: Stupid mistake processing keycode for SHIFT_PRESS/RELEASE. Swapped
 *    bindings for ATTRVIS and DISPMD. Send ACK for packet_to_process packets.
 *    Safety that forgets held routing keys when getting bad combination with
 *    ordinary keys. Bugs reported about locking/crashing with paste with
 *    routing keys, getting out of help, and getting out of freeze, are
 *    probably not solved.
 * 0.7: They have changed the protocol so that the SHIFT key pressed alone
 *    sends a code. Added plenty of key bindings. Fixed help.
 * 0.6: Added help file. Added hide/show cursor toggle on status cell
 *    routing key 1.
 * Unnumbered version: Fixes for dynmically loading drivers (declare all
 *    non-exported functions and variables static, satized debugging vs print).
 * 0.5: When receiving response to identification query, read all that's
 *    available, because there is usually an ACK packet pending (perhaps it
 *    always sends ACK + the response). Fixed bug that caused combiknation
 *    of routing and movement keys to fail.
 * 0.4: Fixed bug that put garbage instead of logging packet contents.
 *    Added key binding for showing attributes, and also for preferences menu
 *    (might change).
 * 0.3: Fixed bug in interpreting query reply which caused nonsense number
 *    of content and status cells.
 * 0.2: Added a few function keys, such as cursor tracking toggle. Put the
 *    display's line and column in status cells, with the line on top and
 *    the column on the bottom (reverse of what it was), does it work?
 *    Display parameters now set according to query reply.
 * 0.1: First draft ve5rsion. Query reply interpretation is bypassed and
 *    parameters are hard-coded. Has basic movement keys, routing keys
 *    and commands involving combinations of routing keys.
