Summary: Braille display driver for Linux/Unix.
%description
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to
the console screen (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
refreshable braille display.  It drives the braille display, and
provides complete screen review functionality.  Some speech capability
has also been incorporated.

Install this package if you use a refreshable braille display.

   The SPK_PUNCT_LEVEL command has been added (cycles through all four levels).
Message changes:
   Message content can now be copied to the clipboard.
   Messages are now rendered in contracted braille when that's being used.
   Messages now honour the Word Wrap setting (when using computer braille).
Pasting clipboard content:
   The PASTE_ALTMODE and PASTE_HISTORY_ALTMODE commands have been added.
   PASTE_ALTMODE has been bound to a long-press of the key combination for PASTE.
Preferences Menu changes:
   The preferences file can no longer be lost during a reboot or shutdown.
   Alternate Paste Mode Enabled has been added to the Input Options submenu.
   The Command Options (advanced) submenu has been added.
BrlAPI braille driver changes:
   The correct BrlAPI client priority is now being set.
DotPad braille driver changes:
   These driver properties have been defined (prefix is DP_PROP_):
      DISPLAY: can be set to TEXT or GRAPHIC (prefix is DP_DISPLAY_)
      STATUS_CELLS: can be set to 0 (no) or 1 (status cells in text area)
      HORIZONTAL_SPACING: number of dot columns between cells (default is 1)
      VERTICAL_SPACING: number of dot rows between lines (default is 2)
   These can be changed at run-time via BRLAPI_PARAM_DRIVER_PROPERTY_VALUE.
   The driver's README contains this list along with examples.

   The older he (Hebrew, generic) table is still (for now) available as he-old.
   The pt (Portuguese) table has been improved.
   Support for Esperanto and Greek has been added to the pt (Portuguese) table.
Contraction table changes:
   The de-2015 (German) table has been improved.
