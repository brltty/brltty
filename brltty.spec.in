Summary: Braille display driver for Linux/Unix.
%description
BRLTTY is a background process (daemon) which provides access to
the console screen (when in text mode) for a blind person using a
refreshable braille display.  It drives the braille display, and
provides complete screen review functionality.  Some speech capability
has also been incorporated.

Install this package if you use a refreshable braille display.

%changelog
* Fri Feb 22 2019 Dave Mielke <Dave@Mielke.cc> 6.0
General changes:
   Chords Dot4 + Dot6 + Dot8/Dot7 turn on/off typing Unicode braille patterns.
   Word wrap when panning to the left now works properly.
   Cursor tracking while word wrap is on has been fixed.
   Support for speaking the current line's indent has been added.
   Vertical screen scroll tracking is now supported.
   Command execution can now be delayed till all the keys have been released.
   Resources are no longer wasted checking non-braille USB devices.
   The eSpeak-NG speech driver has been added.
   BRLTTY can now run within an InitRamFS as a dracut module.
   The -Y [--start-message=] and -Z [--stop-message=] options have been added.
   The prompt-pattern configuration file directive has been added.
B2G braille driver changes:
   The key bindings have been significantly improved.
HandyTech braille driver changes:
   Support for the Activator has been added.
   Key bindings now work correctly after returning from the internal mode.
Hedo braille driver changes:
   Newer MobilLine models are now detected.
HIMS braille driver changes:
   Shifted qwerty keyboard letters are now interpreted correctly.
HumanWare braille driver changes:
   Bluetooth connection problems have been resolved.
   USB session initialization problems have been resolved.
   The BrailleNote Touch routing keys now work.
   The BI 32 joystick now works.
   BI 14 USB detection has been fixed.
MDV braille driver changes:
   Binding changes have been made so that F10 now does exit the menu.
ViaVoice speech driver changes:
   The driver has finally been revived.
   Speech tracking has been implemented.
   The configure option --with-viavoice has been removed.
Linux screen driver changes:
   Full Unicode support is finally available (no more 512 character limit).
   Among many other benefits, Unicode braille patterns now automatically render.
   This capability only works if a 4.19 (or later) kernel is being used.
   The unicode=no driver parameter can be used to revert to the older behaviour.
AtSpi2 screen driver changes:
   The default is now to only read terminal screens.
   Determining which widget is currently active has been fixed.
   BRLTTY is now automatically stopped when the session is closed.
BrlAPI changes:
   The server now starts immediately rather than when the braille driver starts.
   The following new client functions have been added:
      void brlapi_getLibraryVersion(int *major, int *minor, int *revision)
      void brlapi__setClientData(brlapi_handle_t *handle, void *data)
      void *brlapi__getClientData(brlapi_handle_t *handle)
      int brlapi__readKeyWithTimeout(brlapi_handle_t *handle,
                                     int milliseconds,
                                     brlapi_keyCode_t *code)
   xbrlapi now maps unmapped keysyms to temporary keycodes.
Text table changes:
   The se (Northern Sami) table has been added.
   New directives: ifGlyph, ifNotGlyph, ifCell, ifNotCell
Contraction table changes:
   A table for the German 2015 standard [de-kurzschrift-2015] has been added
   (the de-kurzschrift-1998 table should now be used for the 1998 standard).
   New directives: cldr, replace
   The cldr directive has been added to tables for languages that have defined
   annotations: af, de, en, es, fr, ko, nl, pt, sw, th, zu
   (you also need to install your distribution's CLDR annotations package).
Android changes:
   The Android device is now kept awake while navigating internal screens
   (help, the preferences menu, a frozen screen, etc).
   New braille-friendly widget representations:
      Check Boxes: ⣏ ⣹ (not checked), ⣏⠶⣹ (checked)
      Radio Buttons: ⢎ ⡱ (not selected), ⢎⠶⡱ (selected)
      Switches: ⢸⣭⡇ (off), ⢸⣛⡇ (on)
   A notification showing the braille device and its state has been added.
   Support for the Accessibility button (Android 8 or later) has been added.
   The Actions screen has been added - you can get to it by:
      Global Action #5 (emulate the F5 keyboard key)
      Tapping the (new) notification.
      Clicking the (new) Accessibility button.
   Routing keys beyond an element's text are now associated with that element.
   Routing key #6 now does a context click (for elements that support it).
   The algorithm that decides which elements to render has been much improved.
   The list renderer now orders elements much more sensibly.
   The accuracy of left, right, up, and down navigation has been improved.
   Support for range controls has been added (adjust with the scroll actions).
   Bluetooth connections are no longer tried:
      If the Android device doesn't have a Bluetooth adapter.
      If the Android device's Bluetooth adapter is disabled.
      While the Android device is searching for new Bluetooth devices.
