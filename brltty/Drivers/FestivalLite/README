This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the Festival Lite text to
speech engine from the CMU Speech Center [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/]
of Carnegie Mellon University [http://www.cmu.edu]. It was implemented, and is
being maintained, by Mario Lang <mlang@delysid.org>.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if Festival Lite
has been installed. The default is to check the directories /usr, /usr/local,
and /opt/flite.  The actual location can be explicitly specified via
--with-flite.  Additionally, Festival Lite's language, lexicon and voice
can be specified using the configure script options --with-flite-language,
--with-flite-lexicon and --with-flite-voice.  The default voice is
cmu_us_kal16.

This driver and that for the Theta text to speech engine cannot be linked into
BRLTTY's binary at the same time (via --enable-speech-driver) because their
run-time libraries contain conflicting symbols.

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

   Parameter Settings
   pitch     50-200 (percent from default)
